Australia," In name, Australia has adopted the OECDs three-tiered documentation approach set out in BEPS Action 13. The requirements are met through lodgement of two files: the Local File/Master File (LCMSF) (as defined below) and the CbC report. As detailed below, the Australian interpretation of the Local File deviates significantly from what is seen in most other countries. "," The LCMSF As part of the Australian implementation of Action 13, SGEs that are also country-by-country Reporting Entities (CbCREs) have CbC reporting requirements. Whether an SGE is also a CbCRE is subject to complex and nuanced rules, especially for Private Equity owned SGEs, and it is recommended advice is sought to assess whether an SGE is also a CbCRE. CbCREs need to provide the LCMSF file. LCMSF stands for each of the components provided through the file, being: > Local File > CbC report notification > Master File > Short-form Local File > Financials The LCMSF must be lodged electronically in Extensible Markup Language (XML) format and specific software tools are required to prepare the XML file. > CbC report In addition to the LCMSF, Australian taxpayers must lodge the CbC report in Australia through use of a separate XML schema. Where the CbC report is lodged in a jurisdiction that automatically exchanges it with the ATO, this lodgement can be replaced with a notification. The CbC report lodgement notification is provided through lodgement of the LCMSF, due 12 months after the end of the financial year. A local lodgement is required if the CbC report is not lodged in a jurisdiction that automatically exchanges it with the ATO. This lodgement will need to be made through a separate XML and a conversion process is required to align the CbC report with the Australian requirements. "," While Australia subscribes to the general concepts of Action 13 including a three-tiered documentation structure, there are some notable differences in Australias implementation of the Local File. In summary: > The CbC report is consistent with the OECD format. > The Master File is consistent with the OECD format. > The Australian interpretation of the Local File deviates significantly from the interpretation in the rest of the world. In Australia, the Local File is not a TP documentation report, but a collection of transactional data and other information structured in three parts: > The short form Local File > Part A of the Local File > Part B of the Local File The data provided through the Local File includes reporting entity information, transactional data, the level of compliant Australian TP documentation, foreign exchange result-related information, legal agreements, information on the TP method applied in Australia and overseas, overseas APAs and ruling, etc. The Local File can only be lodged electronically in the prescribed format through the LCMSF XML file. The Australian CbC Reporting requirements are set out in Subdivision 815-E ITAA 1997. "," Australia has specific documentation requirements set out in Subdivision 284-E TAA 1953. Transfer pricing documentation that does not meet these requirements is not able to provide a reasonably arguable position and the related penalty mitigation. In straightforward cases, e.g., a vanilla distributor or service provider, TP documentation prepared consistent with the BEPS Action 13 format for Local Files may only require procedural adaptations to meet the legislative TP documentation requirements. In more complex cases, e.g., those involving restructures, intangibles, intra-group financing or commercially unrealistic results, substantive additional technical analysis will typically be required to address the Australian TP legislation. Such analysis will need to consider the commercial context of such arrangements to ensure that the TP reconstruction provisions should not apply before considering the arms-length nature of the pricing of such transactions. It is worth noting that in addition to TP documentation requirements, there is the separate lodgement obligation for the LCMSF mentioned above that cannot be satisfied through a BEPS Action 13 format report. "," Yes, it is as of 27 January 2016, with the dates on which exchange relations became active listed on the OECD website. In addition, Australia has signed a bilateral agreement with the US. "," The preparation of TP documentation is not compulsory. However, taxpayers that do not prepare documentation that meets the specific requirements set out in Subdivision 284-E are precluded from establishing an RAP in the event of a TP adjustment. This means that higher penalties apply if the taxpayer receives a TP adjustment that increases its tax liabilities in Australia. To satisfy Subdivision 284-E, it is required that the documentation: > > Be prepared contemporaneously, i.e., it must be kept by or accessible to the local entity before the time by which the taxpayer lodges its income tax return > Be prepared in English, or readily accessible and convertible into English > Explains the particular way in which the relevant TP provisions apply (or do not apply) to the taxpayers international related-party dealings > Explains why the application of the TP provisions to the taxpayers international related-party dealings in that way best achieves consistency with the relevant guidance materials including the OECD Guidelines > Allows actual conditions, arms-length conditions, comparable circumstances and the result of the application of the subdivision to be readily ascertained In addition to these legal requirements to be able to have an RAP, the ATO expects that taxpayers answer the following questions in their documentation to demonstrate an RAP: > What are the actual conditions that are relevant to the matter? > What are the comparable circumstances relevant to identifying the arms-length conditions? > What are the particulars of the methods used to identify the arms-length conditions? > What are the arms-length conditions, and is the TP treatment appropriate? > Have any material changes and updates been identified and documented? Further, additional disclosures are specifically listed in Subdivision 284-E TAA. In addition, if the documentation is prepared for a fee, an Australian Tax Agent must prepare or control the preparation of the transfer pricing documentation to avoid a breach of the Tax Agent Services Act.

Transfer pricing documentation requirements a) Applicability > Does the jurisdiction have transfer pricing documentation guidelines or rules? If yes, does documentation need to be submitted or prepared contemporaneously? The preparation of TP documentation is not compulsory. However, taxpayers that do not prepare documentation that meets the specific requirements set out in Subdivision 284-E are precluded from establishing an RAP in the event of a TP adjustment. This means that higher penalties apply if the taxpayer receives a TP adjustment that increases its tax liabilities in Australia. To satisfy Subdivision 284-E, it is required that the documentation: > > Be prepared contemporaneously, i.e., it must be kept by or accessible to the local entity before the time by which the taxpayer lodges its income tax return > Be prepared in English, or readily accessible and convertible into English > Explains the particular way in which the relevant TP provisions apply (or do not apply) to the taxpayers international related-party dealings > Explains why the application of the TP provisions to the taxpayers international related-party dealings in that way best achieves consistency with the relevant guidance materials including the OECD Guidelines > Allows actual conditions, arms-length conditions, comparable circumstances and the result of the application of the subdivision to be readily ascertained In addition to these legal requirements to be able to have an RAP, the ATO expects that taxpayers answer the following questions in their documentation to demonstrate an RAP: > What are the actual conditions that are relevant to the matter? > What are the comparable circumstances relevant to identifying the arms-length conditions? > What are the particulars of the methods used to identify the arms-length conditions? > What are the arms-length conditions, and is the TP treatment appropriate? > Have any material changes and updates been identified and documented? Further, additional disclosures are specifically listed in Subdivision 284-E TAA. In addition, if the documentation is prepared for a fee, an Australian Tax Agent must prepare or control the preparation of the transfer pricing documentation to avoid a breach of the Tax Agent Services Act. > Does a local branch of a foreign company need to comply with the local transfer pricing rules? Subdivision 815-C deals with TP in relation to permanent establishments (PE). Subdivision 815-C links with and largely follows Subdivision 815-B, however, there are some important differences. It is noted that Australia does not subscribe to the separate legal entity approach. As a result of the interaction between the transfer rules and the source rules, TP for permanent establishments can be a highly complex matter. Generally, a PE is subject to the same income tax and transfer pricing requirements as a normally incorporated entity. Therefore, branches or PEs would have similar filing requirements. An exception is the CbC report for which Australian PEs of a non-Australian corporation can access a fast-track exemption. > Does transfer pricing documentation have to be prepared annually? In order to be able to have an RAP, documentation must be prepared annually. However, if no significant changes have occurred, an addendum to the documentation may be sufficient as long as the addendum meets the requirements of Subdivision 284-E. Care has to also be given to the benchmarking analysis used. In particular, it is unlikely that regional Asian sets would meet the requirements or be accepted by the ATO because of the significant differences between Australia and other regional economies. > For an MNE with multiple entities in the jurisdiction, is it required to have stand-alone transfer pricing reports for each entity?

", Same as provided for Master File , The TP documentation needs to be maintained in English (local language) or readily convertible into English. ," We refer to the above for the CbCR requirements and below for RTP requirements, and the following section for the IDS. No other TP-specific returns apply. "," The ATO requires an IDS to be filed with the tax return. It requires taxpayers to disclose: > Details of restructuring events involving international related parties (question 17, which must be completed regardless of the quantum of the transactions) > Dealings with branch operations (question 18, which must be completed regardless of the quantum of the transactions) In addition, if the aggregate amount of transactions or dealings with international related parties, both revenue and capital in nature, is greater than AUD2 million, the following information must be disclosed: > Top three transactions (individually) and other transactions (combined) for the top three specified low- tax jurisdictions (question 3) > The top three transactions and other transactions for the top three non-specified jurisdictions (question 4) (historically, the list of specified jurisdictions predominantly focused on tax havens, but the list has since expanded to include Hong Kong, Ireland, Luxembourg, Singapore, Switzerland and the Netherlands) > For all international related-party transactions (questions 5 through 13): > Type of transaction, e.g., royalties, intercompany loans, technical services and administrative services > The quantum per type of transaction > The percentage of transactions of each type covered by contemporaneous documentation that has been prepared in accordance with the ATO guidance mentioned above (TP documentation does not need to be lodged with the tax return) > TP methodologies selected and applied for each international related-party transaction type > Information on transactions for no payment or nonmonetary payment, share-based employee remuneration and CCAs (Questions 14 through 16) In addition to the TP disclosures, the IDS captures information on interests in foreign companies or foreign trusts, permanent establishments and thin capitalization. Separate thresholds apply for these disclosures. As an administrative concession, the ATO has waived the requirement to lodge parts of the IDS where taxpayers complete and lodge the Local File part of LCMSF in XML format at the same time as the tax return. "," If international related-party dealings exceed AUD2 million (including average loan balances), an IDS must be lodged as part of the corporate tax return. Reportable Tax Position Schedule for companies with a turnover in excess of AUD25 million that form part of an Australian economic group with a turnover in excess of AUD250 million must be disclosed. Transfer pricing reportable tax positions include 'normal' material reportable tax positions as well as specific disclosures in relation to ATO guidance on a variety of topics including financing, distribution arrangements, Development, Enhancement, Maintenance, Protection and Exploitation (DEMPE) functions, Intangible property, Marketing and non-core-procurement hubs, etc. "," In most cases, the income tax return is due for lodgement six months and 15 days after the end of the income tax year, however it varies depending upon the entity. Payment of any final tax liability is normally due on the first day of the sixth month following the end of the income tax year. Taxpayers may request a due date extension through the ATO portal. "," If required, this must be filed 12 months after the end of the financial year of the taxpayer unless the taxpayer has received a replacement reporting period (RRP), in which case the deadline is 12 months after the end of the RRP (typically the global parent entitys year-end immediately preceding the taxpayers year-end). An exemption may be available where Australia is the only jurisdiction in which the Master File needs to be prepared. "," If required, the CbC report is due 12 months after the end of the financial year of the taxpayer unless the taxpayer has received an RRP, in which case the deadline is 12 months after the end of the RRP. Refer to the CbCR notification section for situations where the CbC report has been lodged with another revenue authority with whom the ATO has a formal information exchange. "," If the CbC report is lodged with another revenue authority with whom the ATO has a formal information exchange, the Australian taxpayer is able to provide a notification through the LCMSF form, and the ATO then obtains a copy of the CbC report directly from the other revenue authority. "," > Transfer pricing documentation To achieve penalty protection, documentation must be on hand by the date of lodging the corporate tax return. This cannot be remedied at a later point in time. The documentation does not need to be provided to the ATO. > Local File If required, an Australian Local File must be filed 12 months after the end of the financial year of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer prepares and lodges at least Part A of the Australian Local File by the due date of the corporate tax return, questions 2 to 17 of the abovementioned IDS do not need to be completed (this is an administrative concession provided by the ATO). "," There is no filing deadline for the submission of TP documentation; however, TP documentation must be provided upon request by the ATO. "," Although there is no legal or formal requirement for local jurisdiction comparables, the ATO has a strong preference for local comparables and uses local databases that contain information on more companies than the typical regional and global databases. The ATO will generally accept foreign comparables only if it can be demonstrated that reliable local comparables are not available. Regional Asian comparables are typically not accepted due to market differences. "," There is no specific requirement to conduct a fresh comparable benchmarking search annually. Generally, such benchmarking may be rolled forward with a refresh of the financial information of the comparables for an additional one or two years where there have not been significant changes in the industry or the functional profile of the tested party. "," > Consequences for incomplete documentation Incomplete documentation will typically mean that the documentation does not provide a reasonably arguable position (RAP) for penalty mitigation purposes. > Consequences of failure to submit, late submission or incorrect disclosures If not provided upon request, taxpayers cannot rely on documentation to provide a RAP. Whether incorrect disclosures have an impact will depend on the disclosure itself. Minor errors are unlikely to have an impact, whereas significant misleading disclosures could lead to increased penalties. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete? Yes. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed non-contemporaneous? Yes. > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund? > Penalties apply to underpaid tax (shortfall penalties), failure to submit or late submission (failure to lodge penalties), or incorrect disclosures (false and misleading disclosure penalties). > Penalties depend on the entity as well as various other factors such as the level of culpability. > Penalties for SGEs, i.e., any entity that is part of a group with a global turnover of AUD1 billion or more, are particularly high. Failure to lodge penalties for these entities start at AUD111,000for filings that are one date late and gradually increase to AUD555,000 for lodgements that are 90 days late or more. > The Australian Local File lodgement is mandatory for country-by-country Reporting Entities and failure to lodge is subject to the same failure to lodge penalties. Similarly, failure to address MF requirements could lead to penalties up to AUD 555,000 per year. > Where ATO staff conclude that an entity entered into the scheme with the sole or dominant purpose of that entity or another getting a transfer pricing benefit, the penalties will be either 50% or 25% of the transfer pricing shortfall amount, depending on whether the entity has appropriate documentation. Higher penalties apply where there are further culpability factors such as intentional disregard for the law. These penalties are doubled for SGEs. > Where the ATO staff concludes that an entity did not enter into the scheme with the sole or dominant purpose of getting a transfer pricing benefit, the penalties will be either 25% or 10% of the transfer pricing shortfall amount, depending on whether the entity has appropriate documentation. These penalties are doubled for SGEs. > A Public Officer that knowingly signs an income tax return with incorrect or misleading disclosures (including those related to Transfer Pricing) may face criminal charges. "," > Where the taxpayer has contemporaneous documentation (i.e., prepared prior to, or at the time of, filing the companys annual tax return and IDS) to support an RAP, the penalty may be reduced. > In addition, penalties may be reduced in certain circumstances by 20% for voluntary disclosure after notification of an audit, or by 80% for voluntary disclosure before notification of an audit. > A taxpayer with an APA will typically not incur tax shortfall penalties. Exceptions to this include non-arms-length dealings that are not covered by the APA, or non- compliance with the terms and conditions of the APA. > The Commissioner has discretion to remit penalties. PS LA 2008/18, sets out guidance on the remission of penalties. The practice statement provides some very restrictive examples in which penalties are to be remitted. In relation to penalties with respect to failure to have an RAP, given the specific nature of Subdivision 284-E, it would seem unlikely that the Commissioner would remit penalties in the future unless the prescribed documentation exists. Similarly, we are seeing more reluctance to fully remit failure-to-lodge penalties for SGEs. "
Austria, Yes ," Master File, Local File and CbCR are covered. "," There is none specified. However, more detailed documentation in connection with hard-to-value intangibles and services is likely to be requested, based on the case law of the higher administrative court in Austria (stated also in the ATPG 2021). "," A BEPS Action 13 format report is typically sufficient to achieve penalty protection. However, the TPDL does not define specific penalties regarding the master and Local Files. See the TP penalties and relief section below. "," Yes, it is as of 27 January 2016. "," Contemporaneous preparation is highly recommended. For FYs starting on or after 1 January 2016, the TPDL is applicable. If TP documentation needs to be prepared according to the TPDL, both the Master File and the local file must be submitted upon the request of the competent tax office within 30 days. The Austrian tax authorities can request submission of the Master File and Local File after the constituent entity files its tax return (i.e., the earliest deadline for the submission of the Master File and the Local File is 30 days after filing the tax return of the respective year). For years not covered by the TPDL Austrian tax law, the Austrian Transfer Pricing Guidelines do not contain any submission deadlines. TP documentation is usually submitted to the Austrian tax authorities upon request during a tax audit. Usually the competent tax inspector will determine a submission deadline, which can vary from case to case (e.g., from only one week to several weeks). Upon the tax inspectors consent, an extension of the deadline is possible. Following the OECD Guidelines as well as the ATPG 2021 TP documentation should be prepared at the time of the transaction, or no later than the time of completing and filing the tax return for the fiscal year in which the transaction takes place. The ATPG 2021 additionally state that the TP documentation requirements have to be met in a timely manner. If represented by an Austrian tax advisor, the annual corporate income tax return has to be filed by the end of March of the second calendar year, following the balance sheet date at the latest and if the Austrian tax authorities do not ask for an earlier filing. So usually, as already mentioned, the TP documentation needs to be submitted upon request of the tax authorities during a tax audit. "," The Austrian TP regulations (TPDL as well as Transfer Pricing Guidelines) do not provide materiality thresholds. In general, all cross-border intercompany transactions need to be documented. However, materiality thresholds are often applied in practice, which follow the OECD approach outlined in OECD Guidelines 2017. If applied, such materiality thresholds may be questioned by the Austrian tax authorities. "," The TPDL covers the Master File. A Master File must be prepared by constituent entities resident in Austria, if their turnover in each of the previous two fiscal years exceeded EUR50 million. The obligation to prepare the Master File ceases in a given year if the turnover of the constituent entities is below EUR50 million for two previous consecutive years. Constituent entities resident in Austria that do not exceed the stipulated turnover threshold have to file a Master File if a group entity resident in another state is required to prepare a Master File according to the respective domestic law of its resident state. Furthermore, the TPDL clarifies that documentation obligations existing in addition to the TPDL (e.g., accounting and filing obligations according to the FTC) are not affected by the TPDL. Consequently, TP documentation also needs to be prepared by constituent entities not exceeding the turnover threshold. In this regard, the ATPG 2021 stipulate a minimum content, which is required for TP documentations of entities not exceeding the turnover threshold. The required content of the transfer pricing documentation has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and depends on the volume of the cross-border transactions, the complexity of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transactions in question as well as the industry. "," The TPDL covers the Local File. A Local File must be prepared by constituent entities resident in Austria, if their turnover in each of the previous two FYs exceeded EUR50 million. The obligation to prepare the local file ceases in a given year, if the turnover of the constituent entities is below EUR50 million for two previous consecutive years. Furthermore, the TPDL clarifies that documentation obligations existing in addition to the TPDL (e.g., accounting and filing obligations according to the FTC) are not affected by the TPDL. Consequently, TP documentation also needs to be prepared by constituent entities not exceeding the turnover threshold. In this regard, the ATPG 2021 stipulate a minimum content, which is required for TP documentations of entities not exceeding the turnover threshold. The required content of the transfer pricing documentation has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and depends on the volume of the cross-border transactions, the complexity of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transactions in question as well as the industry. "," The TPDL covers CbCR. A CbCR has to be prepared if the total turnover generated by the multinational group stated in the consolidated annual financial statements of the previous FYs amounts to at least EUR750 million. The term turnover should be understood as the sum of the revenues generated from activities on the market. The tables to be used for the CbCR must be in line with the tables provided in the TPDL, which correspond to the tables provided in the OECD Guidelines. ", The TPDL stipulates that the entire documentation must be prepared in a language officially permitted for tax proceedings (typically German) or English. A German translation of documentation prepared in English (or for certain parts thereof) may be requested by the Austrian tax authorities. The regulation of the implementation of the TPDL states that Appendix 3 of the CbCR has to be prepared in English. , No TP-specific returns have to be filed along with the annual tax returns. ," No specific continuous disclosure is required in the annual tax return. In the case of a tax audit, the auditors usually ask for a description of related-party transactions, as well as disclosure of all contracts in place with the related parties and TP documentation available. In an increasing number of cases, an extensive TP questionnaire is discussed. ",s No TP-specific returns have to be filed along with the annual tax returns. ," The CIT return has to be filed by 31 March of the second calendar year following the balance sheet date at the latest, if represented by an Austrian tax advisor. If not represented by an Austrian tax advisor, CIT returns must be filed by 30 June of the calendar year following the balance sheet date at the latest, if filed electronically (CIT returns for permanent establishments need to be filed by 30 April at the latest). "," A Master File has to be submitted upon the request of the competent tax office within 30 days. The Austrian tax authorities can request submission of the Master File after the constituent entity files its tax return (i.e., the earliest deadline for the submission of the Master File is 30 days after filing the tax return of the respective year). "," The filing due date for the CbCR depends on the fiscal year- end of the reporting entity (usually the groups fiscal year- end). If the Austrian constituent entity is the reporting entity, the CbCR has to be filed electronically (via FinanzOnline) with the competent tax office within 12 months after the end of the respective FY. ", The TPDL stipulates that a constituent entity that is resident in Austria needs to inform the competent tax office about the identity and residence of the reporting entity by the last day of the FY for which a CbCR is filed. For FY beginning after 31 December 2021 no notification needs to be filed in case no changes occur compared to the previous year. ," In line with the TPDL, the required documentation (the master file and the Local File, as well as the CbCR) has to be prepared for FYs starting from 1 January 2016. In cases where a constituent entity was officially designated by notice as the surrogate parent entity for the submission of the CbCR, the submitted information can refer to FYs starting from 1 January 2017. Master Files and Local Files prepared in line with the TPDL have to be submitted upon the request of the competent tax office within 30 days after the constituent entity files its tax return (i.e., the earliest deadline for the submission of the master file and the Local File is 30 days after filing the tax return of the respective year). Following the OECD Guidelines as well as the ATPG 2021, TP documentation should be prepared at the time of the transaction, or no later than the time of completing and filing the tax return for the fiscal year in which transaction takes place. Consequently, it is highly recommended to have the Master File and the Local File prepared when the tax return is filed at the latest. "," There is no statutory deadline in terms of a specific date as to when TP documentation must be submitted. However, under the TPDL, there is a statutory deadline in terms of a fixed time period in which TP documentation must be submitted upon the tax authorities request (see below). "," The TPDL does not include regulations regarding benchmark studies. Generally, local comparables are preferred. However, for Austrian purposes, usually regional pan-European Amadeus benchmark studies (EU 15 or EU 27 along with Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and UK) are accepted. When preparing a benchmark study, the five comparability factors must be considered in identifying or determining the set of comparables. "," Following the OECD Guidelines as well as the ATPG 2021, as long as the operating conditions remain unchanged, the searches in databases for comparables supporting part of the Local File shall be updated at least every three years. "," > Consequences for incomplete documentation No, but please note that there is an increased risk of adjustments by the Austrian tax authorities. Further, the risk of investigations based on the Criminal Tax Law (CTL) is increased. > Consequences of failure to submit, late submission or incorrect disclosures At the time of this publication, there was only one specific regulation dealing with TP penalties in Austria. Section 49b of the CTL stipulates that anyone who does not file the CbCR in time, does not file it at all, or incorrectly files the required items in the tables in Appendices 1 to 3 of the TPDL, by intent, commits a tax offense. The CTL stipulates penalties of up to EUR50,000 for intent and up to EUR25,000 for gross negligence. While penalties are to be imposed, legal prosecution (by courts) for such tax offenses is excluded by the CTL. However, the TPDL does not define specific penalties with regard to the Master File and Local File. Therefore, the general regulations of Section 111 FTC (penalties) apply. According to Section 111 FTC, a fine of up to EUR5,000 per offense can be levied by the tax authorities after they provide the taxpayer with a warning or notification that includes the amount of the fine and an appropriate deadline for taking the required action. In addition, Section 51 (1) lit., a CTL (tax offenses) could be applicable, which stipulates a monetary penalty of up to EUR5,000 for an intentional violation of the tax law disclosure obligations. Additionally, a lack of documentation significantly increases the risk that the tax authorities will regard a transaction as noncompliant with the arms- length criterion and, thus, the risk of a TP adjustment is also increased. Further, the risk of investigations based on the CTL, especially in connection with incorrect disclosure, is increased. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete? No specific penalties are stipulated. Withholding tax may be levied depending on the circumstances and facts. Penalties according to the CTL can be assessed in case of intent or gross negligence (usually a percentage of the unpaid taxes). > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed non-contemporaneous? No. However, the risk of investigations based on the CTL is increased. > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund?

This penalty will apply as of the second infringement. Furthermore, non-compliance with the transfer pricing documentation obligations increases the likelihood of a transfer pricing audit. In addition, the absence of the mandatory transfer pricing documentation required to be filed with the tax return (Local File transfer pricing forms) results in an incomplete or inaccurate tax return, which may lead to the reversal of the burden of proof. "," With respect to the application of the general tax penalty framework, although the burden of proof of non-arms-length pricing lies principally with the tax authority, the taxpayer needs to provide all information necessary to allow the tax authority to verify the companys tax position. Therefore, since additional tax assessments largely depend on the degree of intent to avoid taxes or on the companys gross negligence, penalties may be reduced or eliminated if the taxpayer can demonstrate its intent to establish transfer prices in accordance with the arms-length principle, which would generally be the case through the availability of detailed local documentation reports. MAPs or the EU Arbitration Convention is available to resolve tax disputes with the Belgian tax authorities. Alternatives include initiating administrative appeal procedures or proceedings in court.

Bulgaria," Bulgaria has adopted BEPS Action 13 for TP documentation in the local regulations in terms of CbCR, as well as for overall TP documentation starting January 2020. "," Yes, Master File and Local File are covered as per new regulations effective from January 2020. "," No, there are no material differences. However, there are some local specifics that need to be considered. "," The penalties in case no TP documentation is prepared and presented when requested under the current legislation are insignificant. Generally, Master Files and Local Files prepared in the BEPS Action 13 format report should be sufficient to show the arms-length nature of the related-party transactions reviewed. However, from January 2020 onward, failure to present the Local File may trigger penalties ranging up to 0.5% of the volume of the related-party transactions that should have been documented. Failure to submit the Master File may trigger penalties ranging from BGN5,000 (or approximately EUR2,500) to BGN10,000 (or approximately (EUR5,000). "," Yes, it was signed on 17 November 2017. "," Mandatory TP rules effective as of 1 January 2020. Yes, there are mandatory TP documentation requirements that are generally in line with OECDs BEPS Action 13. The 2019 amendments to the TSIPC introduced obligatory TP documentation preparation requirements. Under the new Bulgarian TP legislation, beginning 1 January 2020, large taxpayers will be obliged to prepare TP documentation on a yearly basis. The taxpayers will be required to have the TP documentation with the prescribed content within the deadline set if at least two of the following three thresholds mentioned below have been met: > Their annual net sales for the preceding year did not exceed BGN76 million (or approximately EUR38 million). > Their assets net book value did not exceed BGN38 million (or approximately EUR19 million) as of 31 December of the prior year. > Their average employees count over the reporting period did not exceed 250 people. "," Mandatory TP rules effective as of 1 January 2020. Under the newly introduced legislation, the preparation of TP documentation with specific content within a fixed time limit is mandatory for local taxpayers, which are subject to a corporate tax levy and could generally be classified as large enterprises. To avoid falling within the scope of the new obligation, a local taxpayer should not meet more than one of the following three thresholds: > Assets with a balance sheet value not exceeding BGN38 million (or approximately EUR19 million) as of 31 December of the previous year > Net sale revenues of less than BGN76 million (or approximately EUR38 million) as of 31 December of the previous year > Average number of employees over the reporting period being below 250 people The Local File should analyze and document related-party dealings whose value over the reporting period exceeds the following thresholds: > BGN400,000 (or approximately EUR205,000) applicable to controlled transactions in goods > BGN200,000 (or approximately EUR102,000) applicable to controlled transactions in services > BGN200,000 applicable to transactions related to intangibles > BGN1 million (or approximately EUR500,000) applicable to the value of the loan principal > BGN50,000 (or approximately EUR25,000) applicable to interest rate accrued "," Mandatory TP rules effective as of 1 January 2020. Under the newly adopted Bulgarian TP legislation, the large taxpayers (as defined in the TSIPC) that have dealings with related parties from abroad will be obligated to prepare TP documentation consisting of Local File and Master File. The Master File should be available by 30 June of the year after. However, no requirement for the submission of the TP documentation is proposed, i.e., the previous requirement would remain and should be submitted upon request by the NRA. For the most part, Bulgarian TP documentation requirements are compliant with OECD Guidelines and follow the BEPS Action 13 framework. However, some local specifics must be considered, in order to avoid further questioning from the tax authorities or even imposing penalties. Failure to submit the Master File may trigger penalties ranging from BGN5,000 (or approximately EUR2,500) to BGN10,000 (or approximately EUR5,000).

"," Based on TSIPC provisions, any documents presented to the tax authorities should be prepared in Bulgarian language or translated by a sworn translator. In this respect, the TP documentation needs to be submitted in the local language. The groups Master File may be prepared in another language. However, the taxpayer should be able to provide a translated version of the document (or the parts requested by the tax authorities) performed by a sworn translator. In case the translated documentation is not provided by the deadline, the tax authorities may translate the document at the expense of the taxpayer. "," In Bulgaria, there is no TP-specific return. "," Taxpayers are required to submit, as part of their annual corporate income tax package, summarized information about transactions with domestic and non-resident related parties as well as with offshore companies. This includes a statement of the total annual income and expenses arising from controlled dealings as well as balances (i.e., payables and receivables) outstanding at the end of the year. Furthermore, taxpayers are required by the National Accounting Standards (and the International Financial Reporting Standards) to disclose, in their financial statements, relationships between related parties, regardless of whether there have been transactions between them, as well as the related-party transactions. "," The filing deadline is 30 June of the following year. Therefore, the CIT return and the relevant disclosures related to TP for the financial year 2021 should be filed by 30 June 2022. "," The filing deadline is 30 June of the following year. Therefore, the CIT return for the financial year 2021 should be filed by 30 June 2022.

"," The filing deadline is the end of the respective fiscal year, i.e., a notification for the fiscal year ended on 31 December 2019 should be submitted by 31 December 2019. "," Current guidelines There is no statutory deadline or recommendation for the preparation of TP documentation. As a good practice, to avoid TP adjustments, it is recommended that the file be completed by the time the corporate income tax return for the respective year should be submitted. Adopted amendments Under the adopted TP legislation, the local TP file should be prepared by 30 June of the following year, while the master file should be available by 30 June of the year after. ", There is no statutory deadline for the submission of TP documentation. It is not required to be provided along with the tax return. It only needs to be presented upon request by the tax authorities. ," In terms of the procedural search approach to conduct comparable searches, the Manual states that comparable data could be obtained both from internal and external transactions and the source database should be publicly available. In addition, according to the Manual, exemplary sources of comparable transactions data could be the National Statistical Institute, local industry associations, Amadeus, Orbis and others. It is the NRA TP auditors recent practice to challenge benchmarking analysis for the lack of Bulgarian data and analysis of the local market players. In such cases, the revenue authority performs its own benchmark analysis and test of the profitability of the local entities on the basis of local business intelligence databases. In this respect, it is highly recommended that the benchmark analysis contained in the TP documentation of the taxpayer reviews Bulgarian comparables and considers them with priority. "," Current guidelines A fresh benchmarking search is to be conducted every year. According to the Manual, the TP documentation should be prepared for the fiscal period when the analyzed intercompany transactions were concluded. Any TP documentation prepared for the preceding fiscal years may be used for the following years, provided no changes in the organization and functions of the company or changes of any other factors that may affect the pricing of the controlled transactions are present. The actualization of the TP documentation should be made in relation to these changes for the respective year. Adopted amendments Under the adopted amendments, TP documentation should be updated annually. However, benchmarks may be updated once every three years in case no changes in the organization and functions of the company or changes of any other factors that may affect the pricing of the controlled transactions are present. Additionally, financial data and the respective transaction data, which serve as a basis for comparison of the transactions under review, need to be updated annually. "," > Consequences for incomplete documentation Not applicable. For presenting incorrect or incomplete data in the transfer pricing documentation, the obligated entity can be imposed with a fine between BGN1,500 and BGN5,000. > Consequences of failure to submit, late submission or incorrect disclosures Current guidelines If the taxpayer fails to provide documentation when requested by the tax authorities, a fine for not cooperating could be imposed. However, this fine is insignificant (i.e., in the range of BGN250 to BGN500, or approximately EUR128 to EUR256). Therefore, the main consequence for the entity would be the adjustment of its taxable profit if the tax auditors conclude that the price applied in controlled transactions is not at arms length. Furthermore, a taxable person involved in a hidden profit distribution would be subject to an administrative sanction amounting to 20% of the expense and classified as a hidden profit distribution (unless voluntarily disclosed to the tax authorities). Both the expense classified as hidden profit distribution and the sanction would be non deductible for corporate income tax purposes. In addition, the expense would be considered a deemed dividend and, thus, subject to a 5% withholding tax. Business expenses may be classified as a hidden profit distribution if an entity has: > Accrued, paid or distributed to the benefit of the entitys shareholders or their related parties amounts that are not business-related or are in excess of market-price levels > Accrued interest costs on debt financing if at least three of the following criteria are met: > The loan principal exceeds the equity of the borrower as of 31 December of the preceding year. > The repayment of the principal or the interest on the loan is not limited by a fixed time period. > The loan repayment or interest payment depends on whether the borrower ended on a profit position. > The repayment of the loan depends on the satisfaction of other creditors claims or on payment of dividends. Adopted amendments In addition to the penalties discussed above, under the adopted amendments, failure to submit the Local File may trigger penalties up to 0.5% of the volume of the related- party transactions that should have been documented. Failure to submit the Master File may trigger penalties ranging from BGN5,000 (approximately EUR2,500) to BGN10,000 (approximately EUR5,000). > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete? Refer to the section above. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed non-contemporaneous? Refer to the section above. > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund? On refund, default interest (i.e., 10% plus the base interest of the Bulgarian National Bank) could be claimed on the amounts unduly paid by a taxpayer. "," Voluntary disclosure of hidden profit distribution relieves taxpayers of the administrative penalty, which is 20% of the hidden profit. This allows taxpayers to self-adjust any overpriced group transactions with no threat of penalties. If, in the course of a tax audit, the tax auditors challenge the TP methodology and propose an adjustment, the local taxpayer may file an objection along with any relevant evidence. Then, based on all documents collected in the course of the audit, the tax auditors will come up with a final assessment, which, if not in the taxpayers favor, could be appealed before the Appeals Directorate of the NRA, which may confirm or cancel the assessment or assign a new audit. In case the assessment is confirmed by the Appeals Directorate, the taxpayer may initiate a court appeal. Bulgaria is also a party to the EU Arbitration Convention. "

Canada," Canada has not adopted or implemented BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation in its local regulations.

", Refer to the T106 details in the section above. ,"s Taxpayers are required to file a T106 information return annually, reporting the transactions undertaken with non- arms-length non residents during the taxation year. This requirement applies where the value of transactions with non-arms-length non residents in the aggregate exceeds CAD1 million in the taxation year. The T106 is a separate information return, but it is usually filed together with the corporate tax return (although there are separate penalties if the T106 information return is filed late). Data from the T106 is entered into a CRA database and is used to screen taxpayers for international tax audits.

These penalties are applicable if such adjustments exceed the lesser of 10% of the taxpayers gross revenue for the year or CAD5 million and if the taxpayer has not made reasonable efforts to determine and use arms-length transfer prices. As set out in TPM-13, all proposed reassessments involving potential transfer pricing penalties must be referred to the Transfer Pricing Review Committee (TPRC) for review and recommendation for final action. After considering the facts and circumstances and the taxpayers representations, the TPRC will conclude whether a transfer pricing penalty is justified. A taxpayer will be deemed not to have made reasonable efforts to determine and use arms-length transfer prices or allocations unless the taxpayer has prepared or obtained records or documents that provide a description that is complete and accurate, in all material respects, for the items listed in Subsection 247(4) of the ITA (see the Transfer pricing documentation requirements section above), and such documentation exists as of the tax filing due date. For corporations, such documentation must exist six months after the year-end. For partnerships, the due date is five months after year-end. Further, a taxpayer will be deemed not to have made reasonable efforts to determine and use arms-length transfer prices or allocations if the taxpayer does not provide the records or documents to the CRA within three months of the issuance of a written request to do so. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete? Yes, transfer pricing-related penalties are assessed without reference to the taxpayers income or loss for the relevant reporting year and are not tax deductible. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed non-contemporaneous? Yes. > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund? Yes, interest on penalties is payable from the date of assessment of the penalty, at 5% currently in 2022; if the assessed penalty is subsequently rescinded, the interest would be reversed. "," If a taxpayer is considered to have made reasonable efforts to determine and use arms-length transfer prices or allocations with respect to adjusted, non-arms-length transactions, no penalty is assessed. No transfer pricing penalties under Subsection 247(3) of the ITA should arise with respect to transactions covered by an APA, as long as the APA remains in effect and the taxpayer complies with its terms and conditions. When the CRA has reassessed a transfer pricing penalty, and the Canadian competent authority and relevant foreign counterpart negotiate a change to the amount of the transfer pricing adjustment, the CRA will adjust the amount of the Canadian transfer pricing penalty accordingly. If the result of the change is that the adjustment no longer exceeds the penalty threshold, the penalty is rescinded. An assessed transfer pricing penalty may also be vacated by the CRA Appeals Branch upon review. "

Regarding transfer pricing adjustments, price, value or profit margin differences that result from applying Chilean transfer pricing rules are subject to a single tax penalty of 40% (before January 2017, the rate was 35%) of the adjustment determined. If the SII determines the transfer pricing adjustment as a result of a transfer pricing audit without enough collaboration of the taxpayer, an additional 5% may be applied, unless the taxpayer rendered the information and documentation required during the audit process by the SII, as determined by the former in a notification. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed non-contemporaneous? The application of penalties depends on the potential adjustment determined by the Chilean IRS. Having available the TP documentation would imply a better defense of the transfer pricing methods applied however if it is deemed non- contemporaneous it might be considered not enough proof about the proper application of the methods but this lack of information has not a specific penalty, unless it involves a fault in presentation of the Form 1951 (local File). > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund? Interest and readjustments for inflation are determined under the application of ITL Article 53. "," There is no prescribed penalty relief for not preparing and submitting transfer pricing documentation. However, maintaining contemporary transfer pricing documentation would be accepted by the SII as an important proof of the taxpayers good faith. In these cases, the transfer pricing penalty applicable to the potential adjustments may be reduced. There are discounts applicable if the payment is made in a short period. "

This can take place if the ultimate parent company is required by its home jurisdiction to prepare a CbC report but China has been unable to receive the report because of the parent companys failure to file, the absence of a treaty or exchange mechanism between China and that jurisdiction or the failure of such an exchange mechanism to work in practice.

When there is no balance sheet, or it is not possible to determine the taxpayers equity, a penalty of nine monthly minimum wages applies. In addition, if the documentation is not complete or does not allow full confirmation that all transactions comply with the arms-length principle, the tax administration is empowered to adjust such transactions to the median of the interquartile range. > Consequences of failure to submit, late submission or incorrect disclosures Failure to maintain transfer pricing documentation leads to a penalty of 2% of the taxpayers equity, as reflected on the taxpayers balance sheet, minus any surplus on the revaluation of assets. This is imposed when the taxpayer does not have supporting documentation or fails to comply with the obligation to maintain all documentation for 10 years for transactions conducted with related parties, and those with individuals or legal entities domiciled, incorporated or resident in tax-haven jurisdictions. The said penalty cannot be less than nine monthly minimum wages. 2 Failure to comply with Section 135-(f) In case the external tax auditor fails to comply with the new requirement under Section 135 (f) of the TC, a penalty of five monthly minimum wages is established for the tax auditor, regardless of any other penalty that may be imposed by the local certified public accounting council for not complying with the responsibilities of the profession. Additionally, when the tax auditors non-compliance is because the taxpayer failed to provide the information and documentation requested and required by the tax auditor, a penalty of 0.1% of the taxpayers equity (as reflected on the taxpayers balance sheet), minus surplus on the revaluation of assets, would be imposed on the taxpayer. The said penalty is at least four monthly minimum wages. Failure to file related-parties information return In case of non-compliance with the filing obligation of the information return, Section 244 literal (l) of the TC establishes a penalty of 0.5% of the taxpayers equity (as reflected on the taxpayers balance sheet), minus any surplus on the revaluation of assets, with a minimum of three monthly minimum wages.

After a tax audit, the Tax Authority (Reviewer Office) issues an audit report that contains the findings of the audit (e.g., potential tax adjustments, if any). The taxpayer has five days to file the initial non-conformity script and 10 additional days to file the corresponding proofs (15 working days in total). The tax authority will review the arguments and proofs filed, and issue a resolution. After the tax authority sends the letter of determination (its final resolution that contains the final tax adjustments and penalties in charge of the taxpayer), the taxpayer has 15 working days to file an appeal before the Administrative Board of Appeals (still at an administrative level). The appeals process has three phases (up to one to three years): the initial appeal script, the proofs phase and the final allegations phase. Once the Administrative Board issues its resolution, in case it is unfavorable for the taxpayer, the taxpayer can file a complaint script at a judicial level (within 60 working days from the date of notification of the final resolution).

The reconciliation makes the link between the costs as booked in the General Ledger, the allocation to the appropriate ""service/product,"" then the calculation of the margin and the corresponding revenue booked as reported in the General Ledger.

"," > Consequences for incomplete documentation Yes, companies that are caught by Article L 13 AA but fail to meet their transfer pricing documentation requirements expose themselves to a penalty that is the greater of: A minimum of EUR10,000 for each fiscal year concerned 5% of the additional corporate income tax payable as a consequence of a transfer pricing reassessment 0.5% of the amount of non- documented transactions > Consequences of failure to submit, late submission or incorrect disclosures Penalties specific to the failure to comply with the TP documentation requirements apply in addition to the fiscal penalties generally applied as a consequence of a TP reassessment. TP reassessments from the FTA trigger an adjustment of the taxable profit for corporate income tax purposes (and other taxes depending on the case). Specific TP penalties apply when the taxpayer fails to answer the tax authorities request for documentation either on the basis of Article L 13B of the FPTC (which relates to general TP documentation requirements if the FTA can provide evidence of a TP issue before it applies this article) or on the basis of Articles L 13AA and L 13AB of the FPTC (which relate to special TP documentation requirements). The failure to provide complete information in the framework of Article L 13B of the FPTC may result in: > A reassessment of the companys taxable profit based on information the tax authorities possess > The application of a penalty of EUR10,000 for each year audited The failure to provide sufficient TP documentation under the framework of Articles L 13AA and L 13AB of the FPTC will trigger penalties. Such TP documentation-related penalties are the highest of the following amounts: > A minimum of EUR10,000 per entity and per period not documented > A 0.5% charge of the volume of transactions that were not documented Or > A 5% charge of the reassessments based on Article 57 of the FTC (arms-length principle) The failure to submit a Transfer Pricing Statement as required by Article 223 quinquies B of the FTC or make erroneous statements on this tax return form (Form 2257-SD) will trigger penalties as follows: > EUR150 if the Transfer Pricing Statement is not submitted Or > EUR15 per error with a minimum penalty of EUR60 and a maximum penalty of EUR10,000 The failure to submit a Transfer Pricing Statement will increase the risk of a tax audit as the FTA uses this tax return form as a risk assessment tool. The failure to comply with the legal CbCR requirements (i.e., Article 223 quinquies C of the FTC) will trigger a penalty of maximum EUR100,000. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete? Penalties generally applied as a result of a TP reassessment regardless of compliance with TP documentation requirements are as follows: > After a TP reassessment is made, the additional profit is qualified as a deemed distribution of a benefit. The tax treatment of such benefit transfer may trigger the same consequences as a deemed transfer of a dividend, depending on the definition of dividend in the applicable tax treaty. Accordingly, a withholding tax on the reassessed amounts is imposed by the FTA when the applicable tax treaty allows for imposing withholding taxes. When the double tax treaty permits the FTA to treat the TP reassessment as a deemed dividend distribution, the actual withholding tax applied depends on the relevant tax treaty provisions. In the absence of a specific tax treaty, the withholding tax rate applied is 30% and increases to 75% when the foreign entity is based in a noncooperative jurisdiction. Note that the effective rate will be the grossed-up rate (i.e., 300% effective withholding tax rate in the case of a reassessed transaction with a noncooperative jurisdiction). > If the transfer is treated as a deemed dividend, the tax authorities also usually apply a 10% penalty for not declaring the withholding tax. Such penalty is applied regardless of the good faith of the taxpayer. > However, if certain cumulative conditions are met, at the request of the taxpayer, the withholding taxes may be waived. These cumulative conditions are enshrined in Article L62 A of the FPTC but basically require that the taxpayer files, before the FTA issues the tax bill, a written request to apply Article L62 A and that the amounts classified as deemed dividends are repatriated to the benefit of the French taxpayer within 60 days from the request. However, the taxpayer cannot have recourse to Article L62 A if the non-French related party that entered into the reassessed transaction with the French entity is located in a noncooperative state or territory. > Supplementary penalties apply if the taxpayer committed a willful offense (formerly referred to as bad faith penalties) (40%) this is much more frequently applied by the tax authorities or acted fraudulently (80%). In these cases, taxpayers are denied recourse to the European Union Arbitration Convention and often also from MAPs through the applicable double tax treaty (possibly subject to discussion, however, depending on treaty provisions). It should be noted that the assessment of a TP documentation penalty under Article L 13AA (TP documentation penalty regime) does not prevent the taxpayer from seeking recourse under MAP provisions.

Refer to the section above. > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund? Late interest payments are applied in the case of tax reassessments made on the grounds of Article 57 of the FTC. The ordinary late payment interest rate is 0.4% per month (i.e., 4.8% per year), reduced to 0.2% for periods starting on or after 1 January 2018. In other words, when a late payment interest calculation bridges a period that included months prior to and after 1 January 2018, 0.4% is applied to the months prior to 1 January 2018 and 0.2% for periods after 1 January 2018. Tax reimbursements that may be made by the French Government as a consequence of a MAP do not attract interest. "," During a tax audit and before the tax authorities send the notice of reassessment, taxpayers, under the framework of Article L 62 of the FPTC, are allowed to correct their errors or omissions in consideration of a reduced late-payment interest rate (3.36% per year), which is equal to 70% of the ordinary late-payment interest rate. In this respect, taxpayers must file a complementary tax return and pay the corresponding additional taxes at the same time. The taxpayer can contest penalties for willful offense (40%) or penalties for fraudulent activities (80%) in court if such penalties are maintained at the end of the usual tax audit procedures. "

"," It is necessary to conduct a fresh benchmarking search every year or to update the financials of a prior study. Taxpayers with a turnover of less than GEL8 million (approx.

Germany," Yes, Germany has adopted BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation, effective from 1 January 2016. For this purpose, Section 90 (3) General Tax Act had been amended. "," Yes, Section 90 (3) General Tax Act has been amended to include the obligation to prepare a Master File as well as a Local File if the specific de minimis thresholds are exceeded. Rules regarding CbCR are governed by Section 138a General Tax Act.8 "," In principle, there should not be material differences between the OECD report template or format and Germanys regulatory requirements. However, taxpayers need to be aware that German transfer pricing documentation obligations apply on a transaction-by-transaction basis and that there are no materiality thresholds per transaction. In addition, the catalog provided in the respective executive order law to Section 90 (3) German General Tax Act slightly differs from the OECD Local File template. For example, Section 4 (1) No. 4 lit. a of the executive order law stipulates that the taxpayer has to document the date or period when transfer prices have been determined (price-setting approach). In addition, information available at the time the transfer prices were determined has to be documented (Section 4 (1) No. 4 lit. b). While these differences could be described as clarifications of the OECD Local File template, there is no official statement of the German tax authorities confirming that the German documentation requirements do not exceed the requirements as set forth under the OECD Local File template. In particular, it is questionable whether the specific documentation obligations listed in Section 4 (2) executive order law are in compliance with the OECD Local File template, e.g., the documentation requested for cost allocations or CSAs, research and development activities, explanations for losses, and the impact of business strategies and business restructurings. In practice, German tax authorities often request very detailed and specific information beyond OECD requirements. "," It is generally considered reasonable to assume that transfer pricing documentation prepared in line with the BEPS Action 13 format report would not be considered as being essentially unusable under the German penalty rules and regulations. However, taxpayers should be aware that this understanding has not yet been confirmed by a tax court ruling or an official statement by the German tax authorities. Most importantly, taxpayers should be aware that penalties may be levied on a transaction-by-transaction basis without any materiality threshold in terms of intercompany volume. "," Yes, as of 27 January 2016. "," Yes, there are transfer pricing documentation guidelines or rules. The obligation to prepare transfer pricing documentation is included in Section 90 (3) General Tax Act. Documentation for extraordinary transactions, such as corporate restructurings as well as implementation of or changes to material long-term contractual relationships, must be prepared within a reasonably short period (i.e., within six months after the end of the business year in which they occurred). Documentation for all types of transactions must be presented to the authorities upon their request, typically in the course of a tax audit. The time limit for presentation is 60 days following the request (respectively, 30 days in case of extraordinary transactions); extensions may be granted for special reasons. Rules regarding CbCR are governed by Section 138a General Tax Act. The statutory rules on transfer pricing documentation are supplemented by an executive order law to Section 90 (3) German General Tax Act as well as the new administrative circular dated 3 December 2020 (Administrative Principles 2020). "," There is a materiality limit for preparing transfer pricing documentation. Exception for small- and medium-sized companies apply. The company does not have to prepare transfer pricing documentation if annual consideration (paid or received) from intercompany transactions involving the supply of goods with foreign related parties do not exceed EUR6 million and if the annual consideration (paid or received) in connection with other intercompany transactions (e.g. services) do not exceed EUR600,000. Once these de minimis thresholds are exceeded, the transfer pricing documentation obligations apply on a transaction-by-transaction basis without a separate materiality threshold per transaction. Therefore, in principle, transfer pricing documentation has to be prepared for every single intercompany transaction upon request by the tax auditors independent of the transaction volume. ", There is a materiality limit for preparing the BEPS Master File. The Master File only has to be prepared by a German entity where its revenue was higher than EUR100 million in the preceding fiscal year. ," Other than the general de minimis thresholds described above, there are no materiality limits for preparing the Local File. "," There is a materiality limit to prepare CbCR. For German domestic ultimate parent companies, CbCR only has to be prepared where the consolidated revenues of the group in the previous fiscal year amounted to at least EUR750 million. "," In principle, the transfer pricing documentation has to be submitted in German (reference Section 2 paragraph 5 of the executive order law to Section 90 (3) German General Tax Act). However, the taxpayer can apply for the transfer pricing documentation to be prepared in a foreign language. The application has to be filed at the latest without undue delay after receiving a request for submitting transfer pricing documentation. In practice, many German tax auditors accept English transfer pricing documentation reports or are satisfied with receiving a (partial) German translation of the reports. "," There are in general no specific transfer pricing-related returns to be prepared and/or filed. However, in October 2014, an executive order law with regard to the application of the arms-length principle to 9See Section 138d 138k General Tax Act; https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ao_1977/__138d.html et seq. permanent establishments was released (see above). Notably, the executive order law stipulates that the taxpayer has to prepare an auxiliary calculation on an annual basis with respect to assets, capital, remaining liabilities, and revenues and expenses attributable to the permanent establishment, including deemed revenues and expenses resulting from internal dealings. The auxiliary calculation has to be prepared, at the latest, when the tax return for the respective financial year is filed. The executive order law is applicable for fiscal years beginning after 31 December 2014. Other than that, there are no other specific transfer pricing-related returns required. "," Apart from the general standard documentation and notification requirements under the General Tax Act and the Foreign Tax Act, there are no specific disclosure requirements specifically related to transfer pricing. However, the relevant tax return forms may include certain questions or information relevant for transfer pricing as well (e.g., information on related parties in low-tax jurisdictions for German CFC regulations, information on constructive dividends and information on foreign permanent establishments). ", Transfer pricing documentation (Master File or Local File) has to be submitted within 60 days upon request. Such request typically comes within a tax audit that takes place a number of years after the year in question. Transfer pricing documentation for extraordinary business transactions has to be submitted within 30 days upon request by the tax authorities. ," For tax periods beginning after 31 December 2017, the corporate income tax return generally must be filed by 31 July of the year following the tax year (for previous tax years, the deadline was 31 May of the year following the tax year). If the taxpayer is represented by a tax advisor, the tax return usually can be filed not later than the last day of February of the second calendar year following the tax year (for previous tax years, German tax authorities accepted in this case a tax return filed by 31 December of the year following the tax year).10 ", Available upon request 60 days for purpose of conducting a tax audit. , The deadline for filing the CbC report is one year after the end of the relevant fiscal year. , The CbCR notification has to be filed with the tax return for the relevant fiscal year. ," Ordinary intercompany transactions do not have to be documented contemporaneously, and it is sufficient if the transfer pricing documentation is finalized within 60 days upon request of the tax authorities. In contrast, extraordinary business transactions need to be documented contemporaneously, i.e., at the latest within six months after the end of the fiscal year in which the transaction took place. Transfer pricing documentation for extraordinary transactions has to be submitted within 30 days upon request. "," 10There was special extension granted for fiscal year 2019 due to COVID-19. If the taxpayer was represented by a tax advisor, the tax return for fiscal 2019 could have been filed latest by end of August 2021. There is no statutory deadline for submission of transfer pricing documentation. The transfer pricing documentation has to be submitted within 60 days upon request (30 days for extraordinary business transactions). "," Local benchmarks are preferred, but European benchmarks are usually accepted if no local benchmarks are available. In tax audits, the validity of benchmark studies is often a major point of dispute between the taxpayer and the tax authorities. "," There is no legal requirement to perform a new benchmarking search or a financial update of a benchmarking study on an annual basis. In practice, a fresh search is recommended to be performed latest every three years while a financial update shall be prepared annually. "," The tax authority can impose a penalty of EUR10,000 for failing to provide a county-by-jurisdiction report, providing an incomplete report, or providing the report late (Section 379 (2) no 1c, (5), General Tax Act. If a taxpayer does not comply with the transfer pricing documentation requirements to the extent outlined in Section 90(3) German General Tax Act, a refutable assumption applies, and the tax authorities are allowed to assume that the taxpayers income had been reduced by the amount of inappropriate transfer prices, thereby forming the basis of a transfer pricing adjustment. The tax authorities may apply Section 162 (3) General Tax Act if the taxpayer submits insufficient or no documentation, or if extraordinary transactions have not been recorded contemporaneously. In all three cases, the tax authority is authorized to estimate the income provided the taxpayer does not rebut the assumption. This also holds true when a taxpayer does not disclose relevant data available only from the foreign related parties. If the tax authorities have to estimate the arms-length transfer prices and it is only possible to determine the relevant income within a certain range, the range may be fully exploited to the taxpayers detriment. If the taxpayer fails to submit transfer pricing documentation, or if the documentation submitted is insufficient or essentially unusable, a penalty of 5% to 10% on the income adjustment may be applied, with a minimum penalty of EUR5,000. In addition, for late filing, the taxpayer may face a penalty of up to EUR1 million (minimum penalty of EUR100 per day of delay, Section 162 (4) General Tax Act). The ultimate amount is finally up to the discretion of the tax authority as far as not explicitly stipulated in law. Penalties are imposed after the closing of a tax audit. The aforementioned penalties constitute non deductible expenses for tax purposes. Section 146(2c) of the General Tax Code further allows the assessment of penalties of up to EUR250,000 in case documents are not provided to tax auditors in a timely manner upon request. As of 2017, the penalty regime has been tightened and follows a transactional approach. The penalty regime for late filing is currently checked for compliance with EU laws by the ECJ (see case C-431/21). As mentioned above, non-compliance with the CbCR obligation may be subject to a penalty of up to EUR10,000 according to Section 379 General Tax Code. "," The taxpayer is required to present compliant transfer pricing documentation to the German tax authority to avoid penalties. The taxpayer can avoid the consequence of a refutable assumption (Section 162 (3) General Tax Act) if the taxpayer submits sufficiently compliant transfer pricing documentation any time prior to a ruling of a lower tax court. In this case, the court will not apply Section 162 (3) General Tax Act in its ruling. However, penalties for late submission will be levied. In general, if an adjustment is assessed by the tax authorities in post-audit tax assessment notes that the taxpayer does not want to accept, the taxpayer is able to appeal the assessment 11There was special extension granted for FY 2019 due to COVID-19 pandemic. With respect to fiscal year 2019, the interest starts accruing 21 months after the end of the calendar year in which the tax liability arose (i.e., 1 October 2021). at the local tax authority. Separate appeals will have to be filed against any penalty assessments. If an appeal is rejected by the tax authorities, the taxpayer can file a claim at the local tax court. In case the adjustment is not in line with respective double tax treaties or with the EU Arbitration Convention, the taxpayer may also file a request for MAP or arbitration at the Federal Central Tax Office.

Within one month from the receipt of the taxpayers memo or from the due date for such submission, the tax auditors shall issue the final assessment note, which will be handed over to the taxpayer together with the relevant audit report. Within 30 days of the notification of the final assessment note, the taxpayer may file an administrative appeal before the Dispute Resolution Department of Article 63 of L. 4174/2013, seeking a revision of the case (tax audit results and final assessment note). The Dispute Resolution Department should issue its decision within 120 days from the filing or submission of the administrative appeal. If the Dispute Resolution Department fails to issue a decision within 120 days, the appeal is deemed to have been implicitly rejected. Having said that, the Dispute Resolution Department will examine only the tax items challenged by the company through the administrative appeal. In the case of an adverse decision on the administrative appeal or implicit rejection thereof, the taxpayer may appeal before the Administrative Court within 30 days as of the notification of the decision (or the implicit rejection). EU arbitration through a MAP procedure and through double tax treaties MAP procedure may be available depending on the tax residency of the counterparties and their eligibility. "

"," Regulations to Chapter VI of the TLU were enacted in 2013. The main provision of these regulations is the filing obligation in the form of a transfer pricing information return. From FY2015 onward, taxpayers are required to file a transfer pricing information return in the form of an appendix to the annual income tax return, which must be presented by 31 March each year. Such appendix is a separate form from the income tax return.

"," > Consequences of failure to submit, late submission or incorrect disclosures According to Article 66 of the Regulations to the TLU, penalties for failure to comply with the transfer pricing obligations correspond to the general tax penalties. According to Article 94 (13) of the Tax Code, penalties for failure to present the transfer pricing documentation upon request of the tax authority would be GTQ5,000 for the first time, GTQ10,000 for the second time and GTQ10,000 plus 1% of the taxpayers gross income from then on. Additionally, if the taxpayer does not comply with the submission of the requested transfer pricing information, the tax authorities generally apply the fine provided in Article 93 of the Tax Code regarding the tax offense involving refusing to cooperate with the requirements performed within a tax audit process. Penalties imposed may consist of fines or eventually lead to closure of the business. In addition, any additional tax generated by price adjustments made by the SAT is subject to surcharges and penalty interest. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete?

Refer to the section above. "," Penalties can be reduced up to 85% for the failure to submit documentation (only for the first time) if the omission is corrected by the taxpayer. When the taxpayer accepts the errors in the determination of tax liability, before the tax authorities pre-grant a hearing, the taxpayer must pay the resulting tax and interest payments with a discount of 40% and penalty for late payment reduced by 80%, provided it makes the payment within the next five days from the date of issue of the administrative record (Section 145 A Tax Code). However, upon the letter of determination issued by the tax authorities, the fine equal to 100% of the omitted tax may be reduced as follows (Section 46 Tax Code): > If the payment is made at the administrative hearing granted by the tax authorities, a 75% discount should be granted. > If the payment is made before filing for an administrative appeal, a 50% discount should be granted. > If the payment is made before filing a claim before the Tax Court, a 25% discount should be granted.

Indian transfer pricing regulations provide that the documentation should be prepared contemporaneously and should exist no later than the due date for filing return of the income for the relevant financial year. Accordingly, the documentation should be maintained and finalized by the taxpayer by 31 October2 of the following financial year in which such international transactions or SDTs take place. Further, please note that the taxpayer should obtain a certificate from an accountant in the prescribed form (i.e., Form 3CEB) in respect of the international transactions or SDTs and furnish such certificate on or before the said due date.

"," The New Instructions, which repealed the 2010 regulation, requires transfer pricing documentation that consists of a Master File and a Local File. Therefore, Italian taxpayers (including permanent establishments of non-Italian resident entities) wishing to benefit from the penalty protection regime are obligated to prepare on a yearly basis both the Master File and the Local File. With regard to the Local File, the New Instructions provide that this file has to contain information regarding the local entity and its intragroup transactions and must be drafted following the structure set out in paragraph 2.3, which substantially mirrors BEPS Action 13 and the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. A simplification is provided for small and medium-sized enterprises (taxpayers with an annual turnover not exceeding EUR50 million for the fiscal year covered by the transfer pricing documentation that are not, directly or indirectly controlled by, or in control of, entities exceeding the mentioned annual turnover): [T]hey are not required to update the benchmark analysis regarding the intercompany transactions in the Local File during the following two fiscal years, provided that the comparability factors do not undergo significant changes in such two fiscal years and the comparability analysis is based on publicly available sources.

In such case, the penalty protection will be granted exclusively with reference to the transactions described and for which the information provided is considered compliant with the requirements. Marginal transactions are those for which the amount does not exceed 5% of the total in absolute value of the intercompany transactions indicated in the income tax return. These marginal transactions must be analyzed thoroughly to benefit from the penalty protection. "," Tax year 2016 was the first year subject to CbCR requirements. According to qualification or situation, Italian taxpayers are required either to file the CbCR in Italy or to make the proper notification in the yearly tax return. Non- compliance with such requirements is subject to the payment of penalties from EUR10,000 to EUR50,000. "," According to the New Instructions, the transfer pricing documentation, for penalty protection purposes, needs to be submitted in the local language; however, the Master File may still be drafted in English. "," In Italy, there are no specific transfer pricing returns. As already mentioned, for the purposes of the optional penalty protection regime, taxpayers that intend to adhere to such regime shall communicate the availability of proper documentation on the annual income tax return (i.e., in a dedicated box, Section RS106 corporate income tax). In details, Section RS106 corporate income tax also contains other sections related to cross-border transactions that must be completed: > The kind of control relationship existing with non-resident related parties > The amount of costs and revenues from cross-border intragroup transactions Both the Master File and the Local File and relevant attachments must be signed by the Italian entitys legal representative or a delegated person by means of an electronic signature and a time stamp (marca temporale) no later than the date of filing of the relevant tax return.

Financial statements should include essential data from the managing or controlling companys financial statements and relations with related parties (Articles 2424, 2427, 2428 and 2497-bis of the Italian Civil Code). Disclosure is also applicable for taxpayers with reference to intercompany flows that are to be grouped in costs vs. revenues. This disclosure is required in the yearly tax return and applies irrespective of the fact that a taxpayer decides to opt for the transfer pricing penalty protection regime or not. ", This is not applicable. , The tax return is due by the end of the 11th month after the closing of the fiscal year (FY). , Submitted in an electronic format and delivered within 20 days from the tax auditors request. Any additional documents required by the tax authorities should generally be provided by seven days after the relevant request.

", No. , There are no benchmarking requirements for local comparables. ," The Italian transfer pricing rules do not clarify whether the update of benchmark studies needs to be a new search or a simple financial update. Financial updates for a limited number of years (e.g., two) are generally accepted. For companies with an annual turnover lower than EUR50 million and are not, directly or indirectly, controlled by or in control of entities exceeding the mentioned annual turnover, the law provides for the possibility to update benchmarks on a three-year basis (rather than annually) if there are no changes in the relevant comparability factors. "," > Consequences of failure to submit, late submission or incorrect disclosures If and when the above-mentioned optional transfer pricing documentation regime for penalty protection purposes is deemed inapplicable (with various degrees of judgment), general penalties for underpayment apply. In particular, standard administrative penalties apply in an amount equal to 90% to 180% of the additional taxes or the minor tax credit assessed by Italian tax authorities, both for Corporate Income Tax (Imposta sul Reddito Sulle Societa IRES) and Regional Production Tax (Imposta Regionale sulle Attivita Produttive IRAP) purposes. According to Circular Letter 58/E, higher penalties may be applicable, in principle, when the documentation is not deemed complete and appropriate The New Instructions and the Circular Letter clarified that a late signature and/or time stamp is considered equivalent to the lack of signature/time stamp, with the consequence being the loss of the penalty protection regime. Furthermore, in the event of a late return (i.e., filed within 90 days from the original deadline) or an amending return (i.e., filed within 90 days from the original deadline by replacing the previously filed one), penalty protection can be achieved provided that the Master File and the Local File are signed by an electronic signature with a time stamp prior to the date of the actual filing. If the transfer pricing documentation has been timely prepared (i.e., with the electronic signature and time stamp affixed not later than 90 days from the ordinary filing deadline) but the taxpayer has failed to make the required flag in the return, an amending return may be filed before the deadline for the submission of the following years tax return. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete? Refer to the section above. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed non-contemporaneous? Refer to the section above. > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund? Interest on penalties is not applicable. Interest for late payment (in case of additional taxes claimed) is due and amounts to 4%. "," As mentioned, in the case of a transfer pricing adjustment and non-applicability of the optional penalty protection regime, standard penalties apply. There are cases in which penalties can be reduced by the law (e.g., through a settlement procedure in case an agreement is reached, they are reduced to one-third of the minimum amount). "
Japan, Japan has adopted BEPS Action 13 for TP documentation in the local laws and regulations. ," It covers the Master File, Local File and CbCR. ", There are some differences between the OECD report template or format and Japans Local File regulations. Article 22-10-5(1) of STML Ministerial Order contains the documentation requirements. Key additional points are the requirement for segmented profit and loss information for the tested party and the counterparty to the transaction (including the counterpartys profit and loss segmented for its transactions with Japan). CbCR and Master File requirements are materially the same. ," In Japan, there is no penalty protection by preparing a contemporaneous Local File. Instead, being able to submit the Local File by the requested deadline during an audit may po reduce the likelihood of presumptive taxation (see Section -9a below). "," Yes, it was signed on 27 January 2016. "," Japan has TP documentation rules. Yes, TP reports are required to be prepared. ", There is none specified. , Companies with global consolidated sales of less than JPY100 billion in the most recent financial year are exempt from the requirement to submit a Master File. ," Companies with transactions with a single overseas entity of less than JPY5 billion (all transactions including intangible transactions) and intangible transactions less than JPY300 million (again with a single overseas counterparty) in the most recent financial year are exempt from the contemporaneous Local File requirement. Companies exempt from the contemporaneous rule are still required to submit, upon request by an examiner, documents considered necessary to calculate arms-length prices for controlled transactions (which are usually contained in a local file). ", MNE groups with a consolidated total revenue for the ultimate parent entitys preceding fiscal year of less than JPY100 billion are exempt from the CbCR filing requirement. ," The Local File need not be submitted in the local language. CbCR must be prepared in English, and the Master File can be prepared in English or Japanese. However, for the Master File and Local File, the tax examiner may request translation of all or part of the documentation when not in Japanese.

"," There is no statutory deadline for submission of TP documentation (other than the Master File, which is required to be submitted within one year of the year-end of the ultimate parent as mentioned above). The deadline for submission of a Local File depends on whether transactions covered require contemporaneous documentation. If transactions require a contemporaneous Local File, it should be submitted by the date designated by the tax examiner, which can be a maximum of 45 days from the date of the request during a corporate or TP examination. If transactions are exempt from the contemporaneous Local File requirement, documents considered as important to calculate arms-length prices (documents equivalent to the Local File) should be submitted to an examiner by the day designated by the tax examiner, which can be a maximum of 60 days from the date of the request in the course of a corporate or TP examination. "," There is a requirement for local jurisdiction comparables in practice for Japan benchmarks (unless the tested party is outside Japan). In practice, non-Japanese comparables are rejected by the Japanese tax authorities because of market differences when the examiner assesses a TP adjustment. "," TP examiners would match the year of the taxpayer to the same fiscal year of the comparable companies selected for the purpose of a TP assessment. Pragmatically, many taxpayers use the most up-to-date information, as it may not be possible to match years when preparing the Local File because up-to- date financial data of comparable companies is not available by the time of filing a corporate tax return (i.e., the due date to prepare a Local File). "," > Consequences for incomplete documentation There is none specified. > Consequences of failure to submit, late submission or incorrect disclosures A fine of up to JPY300,000 will be imposed if corporations fail to submit a CbCR or a Master File to the District Director by the deadline without good reason. There is no separate penalty for failure to prepare and maintain a Local File. However, preparation of sufficient documentation does not lead to penalty relief in the case of an assessment. The Japanese tax authority has the right to impose presumptive taxation if the taxpayer does not provide documents considered as necessary to calculate arms-length prices or a Local File in a timely manner. For the taxable year starting on 1 April 2017 or thereafter, a 45-day or 60-day due applies as described previously. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete? The underpayment penalty tax is computed as 10% of the additionally assessed tax (or 15% on the amount of additionally assessed tax that exceeds the larger of the tax originally paid or JPY500,000). The first part of delinquency tax accrues for one year following the due date of the original tax return at a rate of 4% per year, plus the official discount rate as of 30 November of the prior fiscal year. However, for the time period commencing 1 January 2014, the rate is determined by adding 1% to the special reference ratio. The second part of delinquency tax accrues from the date following the date of the assessment notice until the date the additional tax is paid. For the first three months following the date of the assessment notice (including the one-month period from the date of the notice until the payment deadline and two months following the deadline), the rate of delinquency tax is the special reference ratio plus 7.3% for the period after 1 January 2014. Specifically, these translate to delinquency tax rates as follows. Term First part Second part 1 Jan 2014 through 31 Dec 2014 2.9% 9.2% 1 Jan 2015 through 31 Dec 2015 2.8% 9.1% 1 Jan 2016 through 31 Dec 2016 2.8% 9.1% 1 Jan 2017 through 31 Dec 2017 2.7% 9.0% 1 Jan 2018 through 31 Dec 2018 2.6% 8.9% 1 Jan 2019 through 31 Dec 2019 2.6% 8.9% 1 Jan 2020 through 31 Dec 2020 2.6% 8.9% 1 Jan 2021 through 31 Dec 2021 2.5% 8.8% 1 Jan 2022 through 31 Dec 2022 2.4% 8.7% > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed non-contemporaneous? There is none specified. > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund? In general, no interest is accrued on a refund as a result of a correlative adjustment. "," As mentioned in (a) above, there are no specific penalties for failure to prepare and submit TP documentation on time (only the possibility of presumptive taxation if a taxpayer fails to submit the Local File by the requested deadline in an audit; see Section 9a). TP assessments by the tax authority are subject to the same penalties as any other corporate tax assessment, and there are no specific provisions for reductions of underpayment penalties. Grace period of the payment of tax and penalty The 2007 tax reforms allowed for the provision of a grace period for the payment of assessed taxes including penalty taxes for taxpayers submitting an application for an MAP. The taxpayer must submit a separate application to be entitled to the grace period. The grace period is the period starting on the initial payment due date of assessed taxes (if the application submission date is later than the initial payment due date, the submission date is applicable) and ending one month after the day on which the correction, based on the mutual agreement, has been made (or the day on which a notification was issued that an agreement could not be reached). Any delinquency taxes accrued during the grace period will be exempted. However, under STML Article 66-4-2 (2), which grants a postponement of tax payment, the tax authority requires the taxpayer to provide security equivalent to the amount of the tax payment (i.e., collateral). This new TP rule applies to applications for a grace period made on or after 1 April 2007: > After receiving an assessment notice, the taxpayer can take domestic measures to be relieved from economic double taxation. > After receiving assessment notices, the taxpayer can file a request for reinvestigation with the Regional Commissioner or District Director within three months. > After the decision by the Regional Commissioner, the taxpayer can file a request for a reconsideration with the President of the National Tax Tribunal within one month, or no decision is made within three months. > After receiving assessment notices, blue tax return taxpayers can directly file a request for reconsideration with the President of the National Tax Tribunal within three months. > After the decision or when no decision is made by the National Tax Tribunal, the taxpayer can file a litigation. There are three court instances for litigation against tax assessments in Japan: > District court > Courts of appeal > Supreme court "

However, taxpayers should review the price based on data available at the end of the relevant year of assessment and update the documentation accordingly. Based on the updated IRB guidelines, the IRB has given further guidance on defining material changes as below: > Material changes are significant changes that would impact the functional analysis or transfer pricing analysis of the tested party. > Material changes include changes to the operational and economic conditions that will significantly affect the controlled transactions under consideration. Examples of changes in operational conditions include the following: > Changes in shareholding > Changes in business model and structure > Changes in business activities (e.g., changes in group business activities that give impact to local business activities) > Changes in financial or financing structure > Changes in transfer pricing policy > Mergers and acquisitions Examples of changes in economic conditions include foreign exchange, economic downturn or natural disasters.

Yes, a local branch of a foreign company is required to comply with the Malaysian transfer pricing regulatory requirements. > Should transfer pricing documentation be prepared annually? Malaysia requires preparation of transfer pricing documentation annually under its local jurisdiction regulations. Preparation of contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation should be based on the most current reliable data that is reasonably available at the time of determination. However, taxpayers should review the price based on data available at the end of the relevant year of assessment and update the documentation accordingly. As long as the operational conditions remain unchanged, the comparable searches in databases supporting part of the transfer pricing documentation should be updated every three years rather than annually.

", There is no statutory deadline for the submission of transfer pricing documentation. ," The IRB gives priority to the available sufficient and verifiable information on both tested party and comparables (paragraph 7.4 of the Malaysian Transfer Pricing Guidelines). The IRB has a preference for using a local benchmarking study (i.e., local Malaysian comparable companies). If a foreign-tested party is used, it must be of simpler functions compared with the local entity and verifiable documents provided to IRB to include: > Transfer pricing documentation of the foreign-tested party > Financial statements and detailed accounts of the tested party > Financial statements of comparables used in the transfer pricing documentation or screenshot of the financial and background information extracted from the database used > Foreign comparables that can be similarly considered if annual reports, financial statements and background information of the comparables can be provided for verification by the IRB "," As long as operational conditions remain unchanged, the comparable searches in databases supporting part of the transfer pricing documentation should be updated every three years rather than annually.

New Zealand," IRD endorses OECDs recommendations and believes that the Master File and Local File approach provides a platform through which taxpayers, subject to the local transfer pricing regime, can meaningfully describe their compliance with the arms-length standard. IRD expects New Zealand taxpayers to maintain contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation in two forms: > A Master File, providing an overview of the multinationals global business operations and transfer pricing policies > A Local File, providing detailed information regarding the operations of the New Zealand taxpayers and main cross- border associated-party transactions, as well as transfer pricing analysis supporting the arms-length nature of these transactions from a New Zealand perspective Only New Zealand-based groups with revenues higher than EUR750 million are required to lodge CbCR. ", These are expected to comply with OECD recommendations. , There is no material difference. ," No explicit protection is given simply because a master file or Local File prepared meets the requirements of BEPS Action 13. However, a BEPS Action 13 Local File prepared with specific and appropriate application to the New Zealand business is more likely to afford penalty protection. "," Yes, it is, as of 12 May 2016. "," Yes, the IRD provides transfer pricing documentation guidelines. Transfer pricing documentation is expected to be prepared annually to support the annual income tax position. While there is no statutory obligation to maintain documentation, New Zealands tax system operates on a self-assessment basis, where the taxpayer is expected to keep sufficient contemporaneous records to support its tax position. Accurate and contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation supporting that the taxpayers transfer prices are consistent with the arms-length principle, in light of the relevant facts and circumstances, is a key element for addressing this requirement. The IRD provides guidelines detailing the expectations while producing local transfer pricing documentation. "," There is no materiality for transfer pricing documentation. However, a cost-risk assessment when producing transfer pricing documentation is endorsed by the IRD and, hence, the level of requirements will be directly linked to the nature, value and complexity of the covered transactions. ", There is no materiality limit; the Master File is expected to be made available to the IRD on request. , There is no materiality limit; the Local File is expected to be made available to the IRD on request. , Only New Zealand-based groups with revenues higher than EUR750 million (approximately NZD1.3 billion) are required to lodge CbCR in New Zealand. , It is expected that local transfer pricing documentation is prepared in local language (English). The IRD could require that documents in other languages are translated. ," There is no separate transfer pricing return required to be filed in New Zealand (notwithstanding the disclosures outlined above). However, the IRD regularly requires that multinational companies and branches complete detailed transfer pricing questionnaires as part of their routine transfer pricing risk assessment activities (targeted questionnaires are typically sent quarterly). "," A companys income tax return requires disclosure of: > Whether the taxpayer made payments to non-residents (such as dividends, interest, management fees, know- how payments, royalties or contract payments) > Whether the taxpayer holds an interest in a CFC More detailed disclosures of various financial information and other data are required for interests held in CFCs. If a taxpayer is granted a tax return filing extension (which is being granted on request for COVID-19-related delays), this should also extend the due date for the BEPS disclosure. Taxpayers impacted by the restricted transfer pricing rules (New Zealand-specific measures targeting inbound debt) or hybrid mismatch rules are required to file a BEPS disclosure. ", The lodging of transfer pricing documentation and specific transfer pricing forms is not required in New Zealand. ," For balance dates ending between 1 October to 31 March, the filing deadline is 7 July. For balance dates ending between 1 April to 30 September, the deadline is the seventh day of the fourth month following the balance date. Where the company is on a tax agency list, an extension to the following 31 March is granted. ", The Master File is to be submitted upon request. ," A CbCR, if required, must be filed within 12 months after the relevant balance date. This applies to New Zealand headquartered groups only. ", There are no notification requirements. ," Although there is no explicit legislative requirement for a taxpayer to document its transfer pricing policies and practices, transfer pricing documentation supporting the tax position should be prepared before the date the relevant income tax return is filed. Local taxpayers that prepare and maintain accurate and contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation are less likely to be exposed to penalties. The IRD will generally request a copy of a taxpayers transfer pricing documentation as part of an income tax audit or transfer pricing risk assessment. ", This is not applicable. The Local File is only submitted at the request of the IRD. ," Local benchmarking is preferred (Australian comparables are generally the best option if New Zealand benchmarks are not available); however, reliable benchmarks based on other jurisdictions are also acceptable. "," There is no need to conduct a fresh search every year; however, the contemporaneousness of the financial information and comparability of the benchmarks should be assessed periodically. "," > Consequences for incomplete documentation Incomplete or inadequate documentation could result in shortfall penalties being applied if an adjustment is sustained. > Consequences of failure to submit, late submission or incorrect disclosures Even though there are no specific submission requirements, any failure to provide information or documentation when requested can constitute an offense. If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete? Under Sections 141A-141K of the TAA, the following penalties could potentially be imposed depending on the culpability of the taxpayer: > 20% penalty for not taking reasonable care > 20% penalty for an unacceptable tax position > 40% penalty for gross carelessness > 100% penalty for an inappropriate tax position > 150% penalty for evasion or a similar act > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed non-contemporaneous? Yes, penalties are more likely to be assessed if documentation has not been prepared for the tax year under assessment. > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund? Yes, use of money interest would be applicable for both penalties and refunds based on the IRDs interest rates for the applicable tax period. "," Tax disputes are usually initiated by the IRD following a lengthy period of review and audit activity by the IRD. In some cases, a taxpayer can initiate a dispute. The local tax dispute process is formal and complex, involving seven distinct steps. If, during this process, the IRD and taxpayers cannot resolve the dispute, they will likely resort to litigation. Shortfall penalties may be reduced upon voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of the details of the shortfall, as follows: > If disclosure occurs before the notification of an investigation, the penalty may be reduced by 100% (only for lack of reasonable care or unacceptable tax position categories) or 75% for other shortfall penalties. > If disclosure occurs after the notification of an investigation, but before the investigation commences, the penalty may be reduced by 40%. Shortfall penalties may be reduced by a further 50% if a taxpayer has good compliance records. "

"," Yes, please see response above. "," The TP documentation requirements follow the OECD TP Guidelines. However, there are some notable deviations as reflected below: 1. Royalties/Use of intangibles The tax deductibility of royalties/fees for rights to use intangibles is limited to 5% of the Nigerian company's Earnings Before Interest Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA), as per the Nigerian TP Regulations, and not necessarily in line with the arm's length principle as recommended by the OECD Guidelines. 2. Commodity Transactions For commodity transactions, the Nigerian TP Regulations does not solely rely on the quoted price as recommended by the OECD TP Guidelines. In the case of export, the TP Regulations provides that where commodities are exported from Nigeria to a related party for resale to a third party, the transfer price will be deemed to be the price agreed with the third party if the price is higher than the quoted price. 3. Application of UN Documents The local TP Regulations reference the application of UN documents (in addition to OECD documents) in the interpretation of arm's length principle. Accordingly, in certain circumstances where the UN approach preserves more profit for developing nations, the tax authorities show preference for the application of UN Model. As such, the approach in preparing the Local File should not only consider the recommendation of the OECD but also UN particularly where there are differences. 4. Local TP practices Based on TP audit experience in Nigeria, the Local File is tailored to manage the TP risks of transactions documented in the report rather than just reflecting information as recommended in the OECD Guidelines in order to avoid huge additional assessments and applicable penalties.

Peru," In December 2016, through Legislative Decree 1312, Peru introduced a three-tiered transfer pricing documentation structure, consisting of a Local File, a Master File and a CbCR, as set out in the final reports under Action 13 of the OECD BEPS Action Plan. Subsequently, on 17 November 2017, the Peruvian Government issued Supreme Decree 333-2007- EF, which approved the regulations with guidance for the preparation and submission of the Local File, Master File and CbCR. "," Master File, Local File and CbCR are covered. "," The Local File must be prepared in accordance with the format detailed in Annexes I, II and III of the Superintendence Resolution No. 014 -2018/SUNAT, which specifies the content, formatting and cross-references with the Local File informative return that must be included. Although Peruvian legislation follows the recommendations specified in BEPS Action 13, the Superintendence Resolution proposes a specific structure for the Local File (Appendix 3), which presents wide differences in form with the one proposed by the OECD. The Master File must be prepared in accordance with the format detailed in Annex I of the Superintendence Resolution No. 163 -2018/SUNAT. The CbCR must be prepared in accordance with the format detailed in Annex I of the Superintendence Resolution No. 163 -2018/SUNAT and Annex I of the Superintendence Resolution No. 188 -2018/SUNAT. ", Refer to the section Penalty relief. ," Yes, as of 9 November 2018. ", Peru has transfer pricing documentation guidelines and rules. The deadline schedule to submit the Local File informative returns is the same as the one approved for the submission and payment of monthly taxes due in June (tax period May) of the following fiscal year. The deadline schedule to submit the Master File and CbCR informative returns is the same as the one approved for the submission and payment of monthly taxes due in October (tax period September) of the following fiscal year. ," As of 2017, Peruvian transfer pricing formal obligations are aligned with the three-tiered proposal from BEPS, subject to the following conditions. "," Taxpayers that are constituents of a group of companies (both domestic and multinational) and have an annual revenue for the fiscal year of more than 20,000 tax units2 (PEN88 million, approx. USD22 million) and that have carried out transactions with related parties, tax havens, noncooperative jurisdictions or with entities subject to preferential tax regimes for a total amount that is greater than 400 tax units (PEN1.76 million, approx. USD440,000) will be required to submit a Master File with high-level information of the groups business operations, its transfer pricing policies, and its global allocation of income and economic activity. 2The figures have been calculated based on the tax unit corresponding to the year 2021 (PEN4,400). For fiscal year 2022, the tax unit has increased to 4,600. The Master File requirements in Peru are largely consistent with those under Action 13 of the BEPS Action Plan. The information required in the Master File provides a blueprint of the group and contains relevant information that has been grouped into five categories: (1) the groups organizational structure, (2) a description of its business or businesses, (3) the groups intangibles, (4) the groups intercompany financial activities, and (5) the groups financial and tax positions. The filling should be done in October of the following year. "," The Local File documentation requirement applies only to taxpayers whose annual revenue for the fiscal year exceeds 2,300 tax units (PEN10.12 million, approx. USD2.53 million). The Local File provides detailed information relating to intercompany transactions (both domestic and cross-border) and transactions between local taxpayers and residents in tax haven jurisdictions. The second threshold to be observed is the sum of intercompany transactions: Annex I: The taxpayer has carried out transactions with related parties, tax havens, noncooperative jurisdictions or with entities subject to preferential tax regimes for a total amount that is greater than or equal to 100 tax units (PEN440,000, approx. USD110,000) but less than 400 tax units (PEN1.76 million, approx. USD440,000). And Annex II, III and IV: The taxpayer has carried out transactions with related parties, tax havens, noncooperative jurisdictions or with entities subject to preferential tax regimes for a total amount that is greater than 400 tax units (PEN1.76 million, approx. USD440,000). Both conditions should be met. "," In Peru, a CbCR should be filed annually by resident parent entities of MNE groups with annual revenue, as reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the immediately preceding fiscal year, equal to or greater than Peruvian sol (PEN)2.7 billion (approx. USD6.75 billion). For these purposes, an MNE has been defined to include two or more enterprises or entities that are resident of different countries or territories, where at least one of them is resident in Peru. The CbC report requires aggregate tax jurisdiction-wide information relating to the global allocation of the revenue, profits (or losses), income taxes paid (and accrued) and certain indicators of the location of economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which the MNE group operates. The report also requires a listing of all the constituent entities of the MNE group, including the tax jurisdiction of incorporation, where it is different from the tax jurisdiction of residence, as well as the nature of the main business activities carried out by that constituent entity. Resident entities that are constituents of a foreign-based MNE group whose consolidated annual revenue exceeds the threshold will also be required to file the CbCR under the following circumstances: > The ultimate parent of the MNE group is not required to file the CbCR in its jurisdiction of residence. > The CbCR is submitted to the jurisdiction of residence of the ultimate parent company, but Peru has not established an information exchange mechanism with that jurisdiction. > The parent company has submitted the CbCR, and even though Peru has an information exchange mechanism with that jurisdiction, there has been systematic failure to exchange information which has been communicated to the resident constituent entity by SUNAT. > The resident constituent entity has been designated by the foreign-based MNE group as the alternate reporting entity (which files the CbCR instead of the ultimate parent company) and such designation is properly communicated to SUNAT. "," The transfer pricing documentation needs to be submitted in Spanish. According to Legislative Decree 1312, in general, the Master File, the Local File and the CbCR should be translated to Spanish and kept for five years or during the statute of limitations period established by the Tax Code, whichever is longer.

The obligation of preparing transfer pricing documentation would not apply to transactions for which a taxpayer obtains an APA. Polands CIT law tax deductibility restrictions of intangible intragroup charges would not apply to transactions for which a taxpayer obtains an APA with the Polish Ministry of Finance.

The rate indicated in Article 58b is doubled if: > The basis for determining additional tax liability exceeds PLN15 million for the excess over this amount. > It has not been 10 years since the end of the calendar year in which the taxpayer or payer obtained a final decision regarding additional taxation. > The party did not submit to the tax authority the tax documentation. In the event that together the conditions mentioned in points 1 and 3 arise, the rate is tripled. The above point 3 is not taken into consideration if the documentation in full scope is delivered to the tax authorities within the time frame specified by the tax authority, not longer than 14 days. Moreover, the persons responsible for tax matters locally may be penalized based on the penal and fiscal code for non-compliance (with a fine or imprisonment, depending on materiality of the case). As a result, the magnitude of the risk may be measured by the exposure to personal penal responsibility of the companys representatives.

Portugal, Yes. ," A three-tier documentation format as per BEPS Action 13 (Master File, Local File and CbCR) has been formally prescribed in local legislation, as per the TP Decree-Ruling 268/2021 of 26 November. There are, however, specific requirements foreseen in the Portuguese legislation concerning the contents of the Master File and Local File. ", The documentation must follow the format prescribed in TP Decree-Ruling 268/2021 of 26 November. Please see above comment regarding the differences at level of Master File and Local File. , There is no penalty protection regime in Portugal. The documentation will only be accepted as complete if fully compliant with the format prescribed in TP Decree-Ruling 268/2021 of 26 November. ," Yes, it was signed on 27 January 2016. "," According to the Decree-Ruling 268/2021 of 26 November, two new distinct documentation models have been created: the standard and the simplified. The standard model consists of a Master File and a Local File, which must be delivered together, each containing a set of elements specified in detail in the annexes to the TP Decree- Ruling. On the other hand, the simplified model must contain the following elements: > Identification of the related parties involved > Description, characterization and quantification of transactions carried out with related parties > Identification of the TP methods applied > Identification of comparables and values or ranges of values resulting from the application of the methods The simplified model must also include the elements that demonstrate the arms-length nature of the following transactions: > Related transactions of any nature carried out with non resident persons or enterprises subject to a clearly more favorable tax regime > Transfer of businesses > Transfer of securities, shares or equity not traded on regulated stock markets or traded on tax havens regulated markets > Business reorganizations or restructurings > Transactions on real estate and intangible assets The new legislation explicitly provides that the documentation obligation is considered fulfilled only when the documentation file submitted contains all relevant information relating to the controlled transactions in which the taxable person has been involved. Taxpayers who, in the period to which the obligation refers, have reached a total annual amount of income of less than EUR10 million shall be exempted from presenting this documentation. Even if this limit is exceeded, that exemption shall apply to controlled transactions whose value in the period has not exceeded EUR100,000 and, in total, EUR500,000, considering their market value. However, any taxpayer may be requested to submit documentation regarding the taxpayers controlled transactions upon request from the Portuguese tax authority. The deadline for presentation of the documentation in this case should be 10 days. The exemptions referred to in the preceding paragraph do not cover the controlled transactions carried out with natural or legal persons residing outside the territory of Portugal and are subject to a more favorable tax regime, following paragraphs 1 or 5 of Article 63-D of the General Tax Law nor, as stated above, when the taxable person is notified to prove that the terms and conditions practiced in the controlled transactions are in accordance with the arms-length principle.

Qatar, Yes. ," Master and Local File requirements were recently introduced under the Executive Regulations of the Qatar Income Tax Law. In 2020 the GTA released Presidents Decision No. 4 of 2020 (Transfer Pricing Decision), requiring certain taxpayers with related-party transactions to submit a Transfer Pricing Declaration form with their FY2020 tax return. It is a requirement to submit master and Local Files by 30 June of the year following the reporting year, subject to certain statutory thresholds whilst the taxpayer should have at least one foreign related party. The Transfer Pricing Decision applies to financial years starting on or after 1 January 2020. ", No significant differences relative to the OECD format. ," There are no provisions in the law that provide for penalty protection regarding the submission of a report prepared according to the BEPS Action 13 format. That said, submission of a BEPS Action 13 format report should be sufficient to meet local documentation requirements. "," Yes, Qatar signed the MCAA on 19 December 2017 whilst on 9 September 2018, whilst it published new CbCR requirements that align to the OECDs BEPS Action 13 Final Report. These requirements also apply to entities that are registered under the QFC regime. "," State tax regime: recently, master and Local File requirements were introduced through the new Executive Regulations of the Qatar Income Tax Law. Subject to certain conditions, the reports should be prepared contemporaneously and should be submitted to authorities by 30 June of the year following the reporting year. QFC tax regime: the burden of proof is on the QFC-registered taxpayer to establish that the pricing, term and conditions attached to their related party transactions are consistent with the arms-length standard. The following records and evidence should be considered by the taxpayer in complying with the burden of proof: > Primary accounting records > Tax adjustment records; if any > Records of transactions with related parties > Evidence demonstrating an arms-length result (including a description of the intercompany transactions and a functional analysis) "," State tax regime: there is a requirement to submit the transfer pricing disclosure form if the taxpayers total revenues or total assets are above QAR10 million. The requirement to prepare transfer pricing documentation is based on the taxpayer having total revenues or total assets above QAR50 million. Transactions above QAR200,000 (by type of transaction) must be disclosed. If the threshold is not met, documentation should still be prepared and made available, if requested by the GTA.

However, in practice, and in the event of a preapproval application to use an OECD method other than the CUP method, a summary memorandum should be prepared in Arabic and submitted to the GTA for its approval. It remains to be seen, however, whether an Arabic translation of the master and Local File prepared in English will be requested by the GTA. QFC tax regime: English language documents are accepted under the QFC regime. "," State tax regime: per the above, there is a requirement to complete the transfer pricing form. QFC tax regime: there is currently no requirement to prepare a transfer pricing specific return separately or with the corporate income tax return.

In addition, the notes to the audited financial statements, which are filed with the GTA, should support the figures in the annual tax declaration. QFC tax regime: related-party transactions must be disclosed in the notes to the audited financial statements that are filed with the QFCA Tax Department, along with the income tax return.

"," Roll forwards and updates of the financials of a prior study are used, provided the benchmarking search is not more than three years old. "," > Consequences for incomplete documentation Not specified in regulations so far. > Consequences of failure to submit, late submission or incorrect disclosures There are currently no specific transfer pricing penalties for failure to maintain transfer pricing documentation. In practice, general late filing penalties may apply. However, given the Transfer Pricing Declaration Form is to be filed with the tax return, and that tax returns cannot be filed without the form (where applicable), penalties for late filing of the tax return apply if delays are caused due to non-timely filing of the form. Penalties amount to QAR500 per day and penalties are capped at QAR180,000. Although no specific penalty is mentioned in transfer pricing regulations for the late submission of the master and local file, in practice the GTA currently applies the same general penalties imposed on late submission of the income tax return (QAR 500 per day). The transfer pricing assessment of the Qatar tax authorities may become final in the event of failure to provide transfer pricing documentation and supporting information upon request. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete? State tax regime: financial penalties, in the form of interest imposed for non-compliance with income tax rules under the Qatar Income Tax Law may apply in the case of a deficiency assessment due to transfer pricing adjustments. Interest on any additional income tax due as a result of a transfer pricing adjustment may be levied at a rate of 1.5% per month of delay (capped at the amount of income tax due). QFC tax regime: if the QFC-registered taxpayer fraudulently or negligently files a tax return, the QFC-registered taxpayer may be exposed to a financial sanction of an amount not exceeding the understated tax. The late payment of tax is subject to a delay payment charge of 5% per year, calculated for the period from the due date of the tax to the actual payment date. If a QFC-registered taxpayer fails to maintain adequate records to support the pricing of transactions with associates or claims in its return that no adjustment is required under the transfer pricing regulations without being able to substantiate that claim, then there may be a penalty liability for failure to maintain adequate records (not exceeding QAR20,000) or for filing an incorrect return (financial sanctions not exceeding the tax understated). > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed non-contemporaneous? Not clarified in the regulations, and there are currently no cases or precedent in this area. > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund? Refer to the section above. "," Currently there is no penalty relief. A penalty exemption/reduction may be electronically requested as a first step before discussing late filing penalties with the authorities. If no response is received or the exemption/reduction is not granted, an appeal may be lodged to the Qatar tax authorities or to a body designated by the relevant local tax regulations. "

Romania," Romanian transfer pricing regulations have been amended in view of implementing the changes introduced by BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation. In 2016, the Romanian regulations regarding the required content of the transfer pricing documentation have been revised in consideration of the elements recommended by the Master File and Local File under the OECD Guidelines to BEPS Action 13; such revised transfer pricing documentation regulations are applicable for tax audits performed by the Romanian tax authorities from 2016 onward, which may also cover tax years prior to 2016. "," Yes, although a three-tiered documentation format as per BEPS Action 13 (Master File, Local File and CbCR) has not been formally prescribed in the local legislation, the transfer pricing documentation regulations in Romania are, from an overall content requirement perspective, aligned with the prescribed content requirements of the Master File and Local File under BEPS Action 13. Furthermore, the Romanian transfer pricing legislation refers to and is considered to be in line with the OECD Guidelines as amended or revised, and the EU Code of Conduct on transfer pricing documentation. No specific thresholds are applicable for differentiating between the types of elements to be included in the transfer pricing documentation or to be prepared in line with the Romanian transfer pricing documentation requirements.

General penalty provisions for not filing required information to the tax authorities may be imposed (e.g., penalties for failing to provide periodic information or fulfill reporting obligations (as provided for under the law) ranging from EUR110 to EUR3,100, depending on the taxpayer size (large/medium/small) and on how the infringement would be classified by the authorities). > Penalty ranging from RON30,000 to RON50,000 (approx. EUR6,000 to EUR10,000) is applicable in case of late submission of the CbCR or incorrect or incomplete submission of information. However, a penalty ranging from RON 70,000 to RON 100,000 (approx. EUR 14,000 to EUR 20,000) is applicable in case of failure to submit the CbCR. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete? In the case of a transaction between related parties, the tax authority may adjust or estimate the amount of the respective income or expenses of either party as necessary to the level considered to reflect the central tendency of the market (i.e., median). This is done either in the case that the tax authority determines that the arms-length principle is not observed for the respective transaction or that the taxpayer does not provide to the tax authority sufficient evidence to establish if the arms-length principle was observed. The resulting adjustments or estimation would trigger a profits tax liability of 16% (the standard profits tax rate) and late- payment interest and penalties according to the provisions of the legislation. Currently, the late-payment interest is 0.02% per day of delay. Late-payment penalties of 0.01% per day of delay can also be imposed. In addition, a penalty for undeclared or incorrectly declared tax liabilities established by the tax authorities through tax decisions of 0.08% for each day of delayed payment can be imposed. If this type of penalty is applicable, then it is a substitute for the late-payment penalty (only one type of penalty can be applied). If the tax claims are paid within a specific term after the tax decision assessing the tax liabilities is issued, then this penalty is reduced by 75%; however, if the tax liabilities are the result of tax evasion, then this penalty is increased by 100%. This penalty is applicable for tax liabilities due starting from 2016 onward. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed non-contemporaneous? Not specified. > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund? This is not applicable. "," In case a transfer pricing adjustment is imposed by the tax authorities, the taxpayer may challenge the decision at an administrative level or in court.

If any discrepancies are identified in transfer prices, the Slovak Tax Authorities (SKTA) would levy an additional tax at the rate of 21% from an adjusted amount, plus a penalty of 10% per year or three times the base interest rate of the European Central Bank (ECB) whichever is higher from additional levied tax. There is also a system of transfer pricing-related penalties under which the SKTA can impose a penalty, doubling a sanction of 10% or three times the base interest rate of the ECB (whichever is higher) on the sums equal to differences in the newly determined tax liability of the taxpayer. This would apply if the SKTA determines that the tax base is not calculated using arms-length prices in transactions with the taxpayers related parties and that the general anti-abuse rules stated in the Slovak tax legislation have been breached. If the taxpayer does not file an appeal against a decision of the SKTA on an increase of the tax liability stated in the tax return, a double penalty increase should not apply (i.e., only three times the base interest rate of the ECB should be applied). "," As of 2016, there is a general option to submit a supplementary tax return within 15 days from the beginning of the tax audit, which offers taxpayers a possibility of reducing the imposed penalty, compared with a tax audit determination of the tax assessment. That means a penalty at 7% per year or twice the base interest rate of the ECB per year (whichever is higher) could be assessed (instead of 10% per year or three times the ECB base rate per year). "

Benchmarking searches of local comparable companies are preferred, but not mandated by law. "," There is no requirement to conduct a fresh benchmarking search every year. Typically, annual financial updates are performed, whereas new benchmark searches are performed every three years. "," > Consequences for incomplete documentation Refer to the following section. > Consequences of failure to submit, late submission or incorrect disclosures Swiss tax legislation does not contain specific transfer pricing penalties. In particular, there are no penalties for a lack of transfer pricing documentation (other than for the CbCR see below). Rather, the general penalty provisions of each relevant tax act apply. Formal penalties include monetary fines for infractions of administrative duties or for tax evasion, and imprisonment in severe cases of tax fraud. In addition, the following penalties may apply: > Assessment of the taxable base by the tax authorities: if the taxable base cannot be properly determined during a tax assessment (for example, because of inappropriate documentation), it is estimated at the discretion of the tax authorities. By law, these estimates must be dutiful and based on experience in other cases. However, assessments of the taxable base are rarely in favor of the taxpayer. > Withholding tax: if a constructive dividend is paid by a Swiss taxpayer, a withholding tax of 35% is imposed. According to Swiss practice, in most cases, the Swiss recipient has the right to a refund of the withholding tax under the direct beneficiary theory. In the case of an international beneficiary, that is not the direct parent but a sister company of the Swiss taxpayer, this situation results in a higher rate of nonrefundable withholding tax, even if a double tax treaty (DTT) is available. This is because DTTs generally require direct investment between companies for them to benefit from the higher refund rate. Regarding the CbC report, there are different layers of penalties: > Administrative penalty for late submission: CHF200 per day after the expiration of the deadline, capped at a maximum amount of CHF50,000 > Criminal sanctions: > Intentional falsification or incompleteness of CbCR data: up to CHF100,000 to whoever intentionally submits a false or incomplete CbCR that substantially distorts the information requested, and provides an inaccurate representation of the facts > Non-compliance with the decision of the tax authority: up to CHF10,000 to whoever intentionally does not comply with the decision of the tax authority in the event of an audit > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete? Refer to the preceding section. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed non-contemporaneous? Refer to the preceding section. > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund? Late interest is due on penalties that are not paid on time. The general provisions on late interest apply. The interest rate is determined by the SFTA annually. "," There are no special provisions for penalty reductions. Penalties charged are lower in the case of ordinary negligence and higher in the case of gross negligence. Many tax disputes can be prevented using the advance ruling process or settled by negotiation with the tax authorities during a tax assessment or tax audit process (by way of formal complaint). In this way, the number of court cases can be reduced. However, if a transaction was not subject to a ruling, or if a ruling was not properly implemented, disputes may still arise and require resolution. Additionally, if transfer prices are adjusted by a foreign tax authority, a dispute resolution mechanism may be needed to avoid double taxation. Each canton has one or two judicial instances that are competent for tax litigation. The highest court for tax litigation is the Federal Court. According to the Federal Constitution, intercantonal double taxation is prohibited. Therefore, the Federal Court has developed numerous rules on how intercantonal double taxation can be avoided. In practice, these rules often also apply to international cases unless overruled by a DTT. The Swiss competent authority for tax treaties is the State Secretariat for International Finance (SIF), a division of the Federal Department of Finance. Among other duties, the SIF represents Switzerlands interests in international financial and tax matters, and leads negotiations in these areas. "
Taiwan," Ministry of Finance (MOF) drew up an amendment (the amendment) to the transfer pricing guidelines on the basis of the BEPS Action 13 final report.

"," Yes, transfer pricing documentation, which sets out the evidence of compliance with Part IV TIOPA, needs to be prepared contemporaneously. "," There is an exemption from the application of transfer pricing rules for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). For the calculation of profits, the legislation provides an exemption from transfer pricing rules for transactions carried out by a business that is a small- or medium-sized enterprise. However, the exemption only applies to transactions with territories for which there is a full non-discrimination article in the relevant treaty. What constitutes an SME for this purpose is a modification of the European recommendation (2003/361/ EC). An entity qualifies as either small- or medium-sized if it meets the staff headcount ceiling for that class (i.e., 50 or 250, for small- or medium-sized, respectively) and one (or both) of either the annual turnover limit or the balance sheet total limit. The annual turnover limit for small enterprises is GBP10 million; for medium-sized entities, it is GBP50 million. The balance sheet limit is GBP10 million for small-sized enterprises and GBP43 million for medium-sized enterprises. Reference is to the characteristics of the whole group of associated enterprises, and not the UK entity on its own, to determine whether the SME exemption applies.

UK filing is required where a UK entity is the ultimate parent entity. UK filing is also required for the top UK entity of an MNE when it is not the UPE of the MNE and the UPE is resident in a jurisdiction that either does not require CbCR or does not exchange CbCR information with HMRC (unless the report is filed by a surrogate entity in a different jurisdiction with an effective exchange mechanism in place with the UK). ," There is a CbCR notification requirement in the UK.

"," There is no specific statutory deadline for the preparation of transfer pricing documentation; however, the evidence in support of compliance with the arms-length principle to all provisions needs to exist when the relevant tax return is submitted, even if not in a form that could immediately be submitted.

"," Generally, a fresh benchmarking search is not needed every year, although it should always be considered if there are specific factors that may render prior searches unreliable. "," > Consequences for incomplete documentation Refer to below. > Consequences of failure to submit, late submission or incorrect disclosures The level of penalty is generally tax geared and varies according to a number of factors based mainly on the taxpayer behaviors that led to the incomplete/untimely filing, including whether this was due to careless or deliberate behavior. There is a penalty of GBP300 plus GBP60 per day for non- filing of CbCR and CbCR notification after notification of failure to file by HMRC. If no CbCR is filed after the MNE has been notified of the failure, HMRC may apply to the tax tribunal to give an order for an increased daily penalty, which can be up to GBP1,000 per day. The penalty for filing inaccurate or incomplete CbCR information when due to careless or negligent behavior is up to GBP3,000 per day. Under the UKs corporation self-assessment regime, a UK company is obliged to self-assess its liability to UK corporation tax (CT), including its compliance with all aspects of the UKs transfer pricing legislation. There is a penalty regime in UK law that applies in cases, including inaccuracies in tax returns and failure to notify HMRC of an underassessment to tax. For accounting periods ending on or after 1 April 2008, the provisions for penalties are set out in Schedule 24 of the Finance Act 2007. These provisions are couched in terms of careless or deliberate inaccuracies. They are tax-geared at up to 100% of the potential lost revenue. However, this is now calculated without adjustment for the availability of loss relief, and when the adjustment affects losses only, the lost revenue figure to which the penalty percentage is applied is calculated at 10% of the loss adjustment. Under this regime, the level of any penalty will reflect the behaviours that led to the inaccuracy. For an error despite taking reasonable care, there is no penalty. For a careless error, there can be a lower tax-geared penalty (up to 30%), and for deliberate inaccuracies, the penalty will be higher (up to 70%). For a deliberate misstatement that is then concealed, the penalty can be up to 100% of the tax lost. Examples of careless inaccuracies include: > No attempt to price the transaction > Shared service center overseas; cost-based, allocation key applied, turnover; modest markup; but no consideration of benefits test for UK entity > Policy, otherwise arms length, not properly applied in practice Examples of deliberate inaccuracies include: > A clear internal CUP omitted with no reasonable technical analysis to support why it has been disregarded > A cost-plus return to a company that has in reality controlled the development of valuable intangibles not demonstrable as a subcontractor to group members > Material factual inaccuracies in the functional analysis upon which the pricing analysis has been based > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed incomplete? Penalties can be assessed for transfer pricing adjustments; refer to the section above. It is currently HMRCs practice to consider penalties for any transfer pricing adjustment that results in increased taxable profits in the UK, with the level of penalty reflecting the facts and circumstances of the case. > If an adjustment is sustained, can penalties be assessed if documentation is deemed non-contemporaneous? Not specified. > Is interest charged on penalties or payable on a refund? Interest is charged on overdue tax, set at the UK base rate plus 2.5% (3.25% from 5 April 2022). Interest is also payable on overpaid tax at UK base rate minus 1%, with a lower limit of 0.5% (currently 0.5%). "," Penalty protection can apply where the taxpayer is able to demonstrate sufficient due diligence around compliance. This is best shown through transfer pricing documentation that shows that the application of the arms-length principle was fully considered, following a two-sided functional and factual analysis (at a local level), in preparing the relevant tax return and applied to each intragroup provision included therein. Normally, adjustments are mutually agreed in the course of an enquiry. Transfer pricing settlements are required to be reviewed by the HMRC Transfer Pricing Board to achieve consistency across the department. There is a similar board- level review for transfer pricing penalties. As part of the penalty process, HMRC is obliged to consider suspending the penalty if certain terms and conditions apply. Taxpayers may appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and subsequent appeals courts, and the process would be as for any other tax appeal. It is currently rare for transfer pricing cases to be taken to a tribunal or court in the UK. "
