#CountryAustralia Tax authority and relevant,"implementation overview • Has the jurisdiction adopted or implemented BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation in the local regulations? In name, Australia has adopted the OECD’s three-tiered documentation approach set out in BEPS Action 13. The requirements are met through lodgement of two files: the Local File/Master File (LCMSF) (as defined below) and the CbC report. As detailed below, the Australian interpretation of the local file deviates significantly from what is seen in most other countries. • Coverage in terms of Master File, Local File and CbCR The LCMSF As part of the Australian implementation of Action 13, SGEs that are also country-by-country Reporting Entities (CbCREs) have CbC reporting requirements. Whether an SGE is also a CbCRE is subject to complex and nuanced rules, especially for Private Equity owned SGEs, and it is recommended advice is sought to assess whether an SGE is also a CbCRE. CbCREs need to provide the LCMSF file. LCMSF stands for each of the components provided through the file, being: • Local File • CbC report notification • Master File • Short-form local file • Financials The LCMSF must be lodged electronically in Extensible Markup Language (XML) format and specific software tools are required to prepare the XML file. • CbC report In addition to the LCMSF, Australian taxpayers must lodge the CbC report in Australia through use of a separate XML schema. Where the CbC report is lodged in a jurisdiction that automatically exchanges it with the ATO, this lodgement can be replaced with a notification. The CbC report lodgement notification is provided through lodgement of the LCMSF, due 12 months after the end of the financial year. A local lodgement is required if the CbC report is not lodged in a jurisdiction that automatically exchanges it with the ATO. This lodgement will need to be made through a separate XML and a conversion process is required to align the CbC report with the Australian requirements. • Effective or expected commencement date The effective commencement date is 1 January 2016. • Material differences from OECD report template or format While Australia subscribes to the general concepts of Action 13 including a three-tiered documentation structure, there are some notable differences in Australia’s implementation of the local file. In summary: • The CbC report is consistent with the OECD format. • The master file is consistent with the OECD format. • The Australian interpretation of the local file deviates significantly from the interpretation in the rest of the world. In Australia, the local file is not a TP documentation report, but a collection of transactional data and other information structured in three parts: • The short form local file • Part A of the local file • Part B of the local file The data provided through the local file includes reporting entity information, transactional data, the level of compliant Australian TP documentation, foreign exchange result-related information, legal agreements, information on the TP method applied in Australia and overseas, overseas APAs and ruling, etc. The local file can only be lodged electronically in the prescribed format through the LCMSF XML file. The Australian CbC Reporting requirements are set out in Subdivision 815-E ITAA 1997. • Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection Australia has specific documentation requirements set out in Subdivision 284-E TAA 1953. Transfer pricing documentation that does not meet these requirements is not able to provide a reasonably arguable position and the related penalty mitigation. In straightforward cases, e.g., a vanilla distributor or service provider, TP documentation prepared consistent with the BEPS Action 13 format for local files may only require procedural adaptations to meet the legislative TP documentation requirements. In more complex cases, e.g., those involving restructures, intangibles, intra-group financing or commercially unrealistic results, substantive additional technical analysis will typically be required to address the Australian TP legislation. Such analysis will need to consider the commercial context of such arrangements to ensure that the TP reconstruction provisions should not apply before considering the arm’s-length nature of the pricing of such transactions. It is worth noting that in addition to TP documentation requirements, there is the separate lodgement obligation for the LCMSF mentioned above that cannot be satisfied through a BEPS Action 13 format report. c) Is"

If yes, does documentation need to be All financial data contained in the master file and local file have to be made available in an electronic format that allows the FTA to verify the calculations (e.g., in spreadsheet). • Aspecific format, in terms of section headings and the order of the sections, is specified, but the overall content required to be included in master file and local files is consistent with the OECD’s BEPS Action 13 recommendations. • The entity’s financial information in the local file needs to be sourced from the French statutory accounts, and the corresponding account numbers need to be provided in the local file. • The local entity must provide the reconciliation between management accounts used for TP purposes and statutory accounts. The reconciliation makes the link between the costs as booked in the General Ledger, the allocation to the appropriate ""service/product,"" then the calculation of the margin and the corresponding revenue booked as reported in the General Ledger. This requirement is very restrictive for taxpayers and more burdensome than what is required in the OECD Guidelines given the need to fully reconcile the statutory profit and loss (P&L) and the calculations of transfer prices. • Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection A BEPS Action 13 format report should be sufficient to achieve penalty protection, but financial data contained in the report needs to be provided in electronic format.

#CountryGermany Tax authority and relevant,"implementation overview • Has the jurisdiction adopted or implemented BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation in the local regulations? Yes, Germany has adopted BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation, effective from 1 January 2016. For this purpose, Section 90 (3) General Tax Act had been amended. • Coverage in terms of Master File, Local File and CbCR Yes, Section 90 (3) General Tax Act has been amended to include the obligation to prepare a Master File as well as a Local File if the specific “de minimis” thresholds are exceeded. Rules regarding CbCR are governed by Section 138a General Tax Act.8 • Effective or expected commencement date German transfer pricing documentation obligations were implemented in 2003. As of fiscal years starting after 31 December 2016, German taxpayers are obliged to prepare a Master Fileor Local File-type transfer pricing documentation. With regard to CbCR, the regulation has been effective since 1 January 2016 (with exception for the surrogate companies effective from 1 January 2017). • Material differences from OECD report template or format In principle, there should not be material differences between the OECD report template or format and Germany’s regulatory requirements. However, taxpayers need to be aware that German transfer pricing documentation obligations apply on a transaction-by-transaction basis and that there are no materiality thresholds per transaction. In addition, the catalog provided in the respective executive order law to Section 90 (3) German General Tax Act slightly differs from the OECD Local File template. For example, Section 4 (1) No. 4 lit. a of the executive order law stipulates that the taxpayer has to document the date or period when transfer prices have been determined (price-setting approach). In addition, information available at the time the transfer prices were determined has to be documented (Section 4 (1) No. 4 lit. b). While these differences could be described as clarifications of the OECD Local File template, there is no official statement of the German tax authorities confirming that the German documentation requirements do not exceed the requirements as set forth under the OECD Local File template. In particular, it is questionable whether the specific documentation obligations listed in Section 4 (2) executive order law are in compliance with the OECD Local File template, e.g., the documentation requested for cost allocations or CSAs, research and development activities, explanations for losses, and the impact of business strategies and business restructurings. In practice, German tax authorities often request very detailed and specific information beyond OECD requirements. • Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection It is generally considered reasonable to assume that transfer pricing documentation prepared in line with the BEPS Action 13 format report would not be considered as being “essentially unusable” under the German penalty rules and regulations. However, taxpayers should be aware that this understanding has not yet been confirmed by a tax court ruling or an official statement by the German tax authorities. Most importantly, taxpayers should be aware that penalties may be levied on a transaction-by-transaction basis without any materiality threshold in terms of intercompany volume. c) Is"

The main differences of the minimum required content of the Local File for Greek transfer pricing documentation purposes and the sample content suggested under BEPS Action 13 are: • The Greek rules require analysis of all transactions, not only of material transactions. • The Greek rules require explicit reference to the group pricing policy applied and to any debit or credit transfer pricing adjustments that may have taken place. • The Greek rules require analysis to be included regarding any business restructurings subject to “transfer of functions” rules (Article 51 of the Income Tax Code). • The Greek rules require a flowchart of transactions. • The Greek rules require additional information such as financial statements of affiliates with which ICO transactions exist and that are located in noncooperative jurisdictions. • The Greek rules require a statement to be included by the taxpayer committing that additional information may be provided upon request. • Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection The penalties for late/inaccurate filing of the CbCR stands at EUR10,000, while the penalty for the non-filing of the CbCR amounts to EUR20,000. c) Is"

Please note that both Master File and Local File thresholds are based on the annual consolidated group revenue figure, and not the local Irish entity(s) financial results. The statutory deadline for preparing the Master file and Local file reports are in line with the corporation tax return filing deadline (i.e. nine months after a companies accounting year-end). As an example, a company with an accounting year ending 31 December 2021, it is expected that transfer pricing documentation would be in place by 23 September 2022.

It has not implemented country-by-country reporting but only implemented the master file and local file requirement. • Coverage in terms of Master File, Local File and CbCR TP documentation requirements in Madagascar only include master file about the multinational group as a whole and local file concerning the local entity and its controlled transactions. CbCR is not yet referred to the TP documentation requirements. • Effective or expected commencement date 2020 financial year (FY20) is the first financial year concerned by the TP documentation. The reporting of this FY20 TP documentation was postponed to no later than 31 March 2022. • Material differences from OECD report template or format The local TP documentation (master file and local file) report format has not been issued yet. However, based on the minimum content of master file and local file listed in the Note No. 012-2021/MEF/SG/DGI/DLFC/SFI, the minimum content of the local TP documentation is quite similar to the OECD content. The local regulations include in its list of information required for local file an additional specific bullet point related to (i) the obligation to list transactions with associates and (ii) to insert in local file information on transactions with companies located in privileged tax regime states. • Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection The TP documentation (MF and LF) should comply with the local regulations’ format template that will be issued by the DGI (which we assume will be based on OECD Template as Note No. 012-2021/MEF/SG/DGI/DLFC/SFI refers to OECD guidelines on mandatory information required). However, the DGI has the right to assess its content, and there is still a risk of penalty in the case where some mandatory information is missing or not provided on time upon request of tax authorities in case of tax audit. c) Is"

No. • Coverage in terms of Master File, Local File and CbCR No clear guidance has been provided to date regarding the content of transfer pricing documentation. Although BEPS Action 13 is not officially applicable, the law makes reference to general information regarding the group and specific information regarding the documented entity to be provided within a transfer pricing documentation. CbCR is applicable. • Effective or expected commencement date The effective date is 1 January 2019. • Material differences from OECD report template or format The report template or format should be determined by a decree of the Minister of Finance. To the best of our knowledge, such decree has not yet been published. Given that the Mauritanian transfer pricing regulations are clearly inspired from those of the OECD, we believe that there should be no material differences from the OECD report template or format. • Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection A BEPS Action 13 format report should be sufficient to achieve penalty protection, but financial data relating to the Mauritanian entity itself (including amounts of intragroup transactions) needs to be sourced from the Mauritanian statutory accounts. c) Is"

Taxpayers required to submit the master file and local file informative returns should do it through the technological platform, as well as the digital formats for filing such informative returns, available on the SAT website for consultation and filing. • Material differences from OECD report template or format On 15 May 2017, the SAT published the final transfer pricing regulations listing the specific requirements to comply with Article 76-A of the ITL. There are differences between the OECD report template or format and Mexico’s regulations: • Master file: specific differences in the description of the requirements for the general description of the MNE’s business activities, as well as on the information related to financial activities of the MNE • Local file: material differences with additional requirements, compared with the OECD report template, such as the requirement of a comprehensive description and taxpayer’s participation on the MNE’s value chain; detailed description of transfer pricing policies; development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation of intangibles (DEMPE) analysis and functional analysis per evaluated transaction and segmented financial information requirements; and, importantly, financial statements for the taxpayer and the tested parties as well as financial information of all the foreign related parties that are counterparties in the evaluated transactions These transfer pricing informative returns are an additional obligation to the contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation that must be maintained by the taxpayers in Mexico. • Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection Not applicable.

#CountryNew Zealand Tax authority and relevant,"implementation overview • Has the jurisdiction adopted or implemented BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation in the local regulations? IRD endorses OECD’s recommendations and believes that the master file and local file approach provides a platform through which taxpayers, subject to the local transfer pricing regime, can meaningfully describe their compliance with the arm’s-length standard. IRD expects New Zealand taxpayers to maintain contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation in two forms: • A master file, providing an overview of the multinational’s global business operations and transfer pricing policies • A local file, providing detailed information regarding the operations of the New Zealand taxpayers and main crossborder associated-party transactions, as well as transfer pricing analysis supporting the arm’s-length nature of these transactions from a New Zealand perspective Only New Zealand-based groups with revenues higher than EUR750 million are required to lodge CbCR. • Coverage in terms of Master File, Local File and CbCR These are expected to comply with OECD recommendations. • Effective or expected commencement date It is expected for income years commencing on or after 1 January 2016. • Material differences from OECD report template or format There is no material difference. • Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection No explicit protection is given simply because a master file or local file prepared meets the requirements of BEPS Action 13.

#CountryNigeria Tax authority and relevant,"implementation overview • Has the jurisdiction adopted or implemented BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation in the local regulations? Yes. The new regulations incorporate the master file and local file as recommended under BEPS Action 13 on TP documentation. Also, there is CbCR Regulations enacted in 2018. • Coverage in terms of Master File, Local File, and CbCR Yes, please see response above. • Effective or expected commencement date The TP Regulations and CbCR Regulations are effective as of 12 March 2018 and 1 January 2018 respectively. • Material differences from OECD report template or format The TP documentation requirements follow the OECD TP Guidelines. However, there are some notable deviations as reflected below: 1. Royalties/Use of intangibles The tax deductibility of royalties/fees for rights to use intangibles is limited to 5% of the Nigerian company's Earnings Before Interest Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA), as per the Nigerian TP Regulations, and not necessarily in line with the arm's length principle as recommended by the OECD Guidelines. 2. Commodity Transactions For commodity transactions, the Nigerian TP Regulations does not solely rely on the quoted price as recommended by the OECD TP Guidelines. In the case of export, the TP Regulations provides that where commodities are exported from Nigeria to a related party for resale to a third party, the transfer price will be deemed to be the price agreed with the third party if the price is higher than the quoted price. 3. Application of UN Documents The local TP Regulations reference the application of UN documents (in addition to OECD documents) in the interpretation of arm's length principle. Accordingly, in certain circumstances where the UN approach preserves more profit for developing nations, the tax authorities show preference for the application of UN Model. As such, the approach in preparing the local file should not only consider the recommendation of the OECD but also UN particularly where there are differences.  4. Local TP practices Based on TP audit experience in Nigeria, the local file is tailored to manage the TP risks of transactions documented in the report rather than just reflecting information as recommended in the OECD Guidelines in order to avoid huge additional assessments and applicable penalties. • Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection A TP report that is compliant with the BEPS Action13 format and includes the points reflected in the paragraph above should meet the requirement of the FIRS. c) Is"

#CountryRomania Tax authority and relevant,"implementation overview • Has the jurisdiction adopted or implemented BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation in the local regulations? Romanian transfer pricing regulations have been amended in view of implementing the changes introduced by BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation. In 2016, the Romanian regulations regarding the required content of the transfer pricing documentation have been revised in consideration of the elements recommended by the Master File and Local File under the OECD Guidelines to BEPS Action 13; such revised transfer pricing documentation regulations are applicable for tax audits performed by the Romanian tax authorities from 2016 onward, which may also cover tax years prior to 2016. • Coverage in terms of Master File, Local File and CbCR Yes, although a three-tiered documentation format as per BEPS Action 13 (Master File, Local File and CbCR) has not been formally prescribed in the local legislation, the transfer pricing documentation regulations in Romania are, from an overall content requirement perspective, aligned with the prescribed content requirements of the Master File and Local File under BEPS Action 13. Furthermore, the Romanian transfer pricing legislation refers to and is considered to be in line with the OECD Guidelines as amended or revised, and the EU Code of Conduct on transfer pricing documentation. No specific thresholds are applicable for differentiating between the types of elements to be included in the transfer pricing documentation or to be prepared in line with the Romanian transfer pricing documentation requirements. Local filing of CbCR often required in Romania as automatic exchange relationships of non-EU parent CbCR filings to Romania have not been activated per the OECD webpage. Romania is a nonreciprocal jurisdiction. Local filing is required using Romanian specific XML schema as provided by the Romanian tax authorities. • Effective or expected commencement date Revised transfer pricing documentation regulations are applicable for tax audits performed by the Romanian tax authorities from 2016 onward, which may also cover tax years prior to 2016. • Material differences from OECD report template or format There are no material differences between the OECD report template or format and Romania’s regulations.
