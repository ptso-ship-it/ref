Australia ," > Has the jurisdiction adopted or implemented BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation in the local regulations? In name, Australia has adopted the OECDs three-tiered documentation approach set out in BEPS Action 13. The requirements are met through lodgement of two files: the Local File/Master File (LCMSF) (as defined below) and the CbC report. As detailed below, the Australian interpretation of the Local File deviates significantly from what is seen in most other countries. > Coverage in terms of Master File, Local File and CbCR The LCMSF As part of the Australian implementation of Action 13, SGEs that are also country-by-country Reporting Entities (CbCREs) have CbC reporting requirements. Whether an SGE is also a CbCRE is subject to complex and nuanced rules, especially for Private Equity owned SGEs, and it is recommended advice is sought to assess whether an SGE is also a CbCRE. CbCREs need to provide the LCMSF file. LCMSF stands for each of the components provided through the file, being: > Local File > CbC report notification > Master File > Short-form Local File > Financials The LCMSF must be lodged electronically in Extensible Markup Language (XML) format and specific software tools are required to prepare the XML file. > CbC report In addition to the LCMSF, Australian taxpayers must lodge the CbC report in Australia through use of a separate XML schema. Where the CbC report is lodged in a jurisdiction that automatically exchanges it with the ATO, this lodgement can be replaced with a notification. The CbC report lodgement notification is provided through lodgement of the LCMSF, due 12 months after the end of the financial year. A local lodgement is required if the CbC report is not lodged in a jurisdiction that automatically exchanges it with the ATO. This lodgement will need to be made through a separate XML and a conversion process is required to align the CbC report with the Australian requirements. > Effective or expected commencement date The effective commencement date is 1 January 2016. > Material differences from OECD report template or format While Australia subscribes to the general concepts of Action 13 including a three-tiered documentation structure, there are some notable differences in Australias implementation of the Local File. In summary: > The CbC report is consistent with the OECD format. > The Master File is consistent with the OECD format. > The Australian interpretation of the Local File deviates significantly from the interpretation in the rest of the world. In Australia, the Local File is not a TP documentation report, but a collection of transactional data and other information structured in three parts: > The short form Local File > Part A of the Local File > Part B of the Local File The data provided through the Local File includes reporting entity information, transactional data, the level of compliant Australian TP documentation, foreign exchange result-related information, legal agreements, information on the TP method applied in Australia and overseas, overseas APAs and ruling, etc. The Local File can only be lodged electronically in the prescribed format through the LCMSF XML file. The Australian CbC Reporting requirements are set out in Subdivision 815-E ITAA 1997. > Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection Australia has specific documentation requirements set out in Subdivision 284-E TAA 1953.

Austria ," > Has the jurisdiction adopted or implemented BEPS Action 13 for TP documentation in the local regulations? Yes > Coverage in terms of Master File, Local File and CbCR Master File, Local File and CbCR are covered. > Effective or expected commencement date The Austrian TPDL is applicable for FYs beginning on or after 1 January 2016. > Material differences from OECD report template or format There is none specified. However, more detailed documentation in connection with hard-to-value intangibles and services is likely to be requested, based on the case law of the higher administrative court in Austria (stated also in the ATPG 2021). > Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection A BEPS Action 13 format report is typically sufficient to achieve penalty protection. However, the TPDL does not define specific penalties regarding the master and Local Files. See the TP penalties and relief section below. "," Agreement (MCAA) on the exchange of CbCR Yes, it is as of 27 January 2016. ","? Contemporaneous preparation is highly recommended. For FYs starting on or after 1 January 2016, the TPDL is applicable. If TP documentation needs to be prepared according to the TPDL, both the Master File and the Local File must be submitted upon the request of the competent tax office within 30 days. The Austrian tax authorities can request submission of the Master File and Local File after the constituent entity files its tax return (i.e., the earliest deadline for the submission of the Master File and the Local File is 30 days after filing the tax return of the respective year). For years not covered by the TPDL Austrian tax law, the Austrian Transfer Pricing Guidelines do not contain any submission deadlines. TP documentation is usually submitted to the Austrian tax authorities upon request during a tax audit. Usually the competent tax inspector will determine a submission deadline, which can vary from case to case (e.g., from only one week to several weeks). Upon the tax inspectors consent, an extension of the deadline is possible. Following the OECD Guidelines as well as the ATPG 2021 TP documentation should be prepared at the time of the transaction, or no later than the time of completing and filing the tax return for the fiscal year in which the transaction takes place. The ATPG 2021 additionally state that the TP documentation requirements have to be met in a timely manner. If represented by an Austrian tax advisor, the annual corporate income tax (CIT) return has to be filed by the end of March of the second calendar year, following the balance sheet date at the latest  and if the Austrian tax authorities do not ask for an earlier filing. So usually, as already mentioned, the TP documentation needs to be submitted upon request of the tax authorities during a tax audit. "," The Austrian TP regulations (TPDL as well as Transfer Pricing Guidelines) do not provide materiality thresholds. In general, all cross-border intercompany transactions need to be documented. However, materiality thresholds are often applied in practice, which follow the OECD approach outlined in OECD Guidelines 2017. If applied, such materiality thresholds may be questioned by the Austrian tax authorities. "," The TPDL covers the Master File. A Master File must be prepared by constituent entities resident in Austria, if their turnover in each of the previous two fiscal years exceeded EUR50 million. The obligation to prepare the Master File ceases in a given year if the turnover of the constituent entities is below EUR50 million for two previous consecutive years. Constituent entities resident in Austria that do not exceed the stipulated turnover threshold have to file a Master File if a group entity resident in another state is required to prepare a Master File according to the respective domestic law of its resident state. Furthermore, the TPDL clarifies that documentation obligations existing in addition to the TPDL (e.g., accounting and filing obligations according to the FTC) are not affected by the TPDL. Consequently, TP documentation also needs to be prepared by constituent entities not exceeding the turnover threshold. In this regard, the ATPG 2021 stipulate a minimum content, which is required for TP documentations of entities not exceeding the turnover threshold. The required content of the transfer pricing documentation has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and depends on the volume of the cross-border transactions, the complexity of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transactions in question as well as the industry. "," The TPDL covers the Local File. A Local File must be prepared by constituent entities resident in Austria, if their turnover in each of the previous two FYs exceeded EUR50 million. The obligation to prepare the Local File ceases in a given year, if the turnover of the constituent entities is below EUR50 million for two previous consecutive years. Furthermore, the TPDL clarifies that documentation obligations existing in addition to the TPDL (e.g., accounting and filing obligations according to the FTC) are not affected by the TPDL. Consequently, TP documentation also needs to be prepared by constituent entities not exceeding the turnover threshold. In this regard, the ATPG 2021 stipulate a minimum content, which is required for TP documentations of entities not exceeding the turnover threshold. The required content of the transfer pricing documentation has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and depends on the volume of the cross-border transactions, the complexity of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transactions in question as well as the industry. "," The TPDL covers CbCR. A CbCR has to be prepared if the total turnover generated by the multinational group stated in the consolidated annual financial statements of the previous FYs amounts to at least EUR750 million. The term turnover should be understood as the sum of the revenues generated from activities on the market. The tables to be used for the CbCR must be in line with the tables provided in the TPDL, which correspond to the tables provided in the OECD Guidelines. "," The CIT return has to be filed by 31 March of the second calendar year following the balance sheet date at the latest, if represented by an Austrian tax advisor. If not represented by an Austrian tax advisor, CIT returns must be filed by 30 June of the calendar year following the balance sheet date at the latest, if filed electronically (CIT returns for permanent establishments need to be filed by 30 April at the latest). "," A Master File has to be submitted upon the request of the competent tax office within 30 days. The Austrian tax authorities can request submission of the Master File after the constituent entity files its tax return (i.e., the earliest deadline for the submission of the Master File is 30 days after filing the tax return of the respective year). "," The filing due date for the CbCR depends on the fiscal yearend of the reporting entity (usually the groups fiscal yearend). If the Austrian constituent entity is the reporting entity, the CbCR has to be filed electronically (via FinanzOnline) with the competent tax office within 12 months after the end of the respective FY. > CbCR notification The TPDL stipulates that a constituent entity that is resident in Austria needs to inform the competent tax office about the identity and residence of the reporting entity by the last day of the FY for which a CbCR is filed. For FY beginning after 31 December 2021 no notification needs to be filed in case no changes occur compared to the previous year. ",No match found," There is no statutory deadline in terms of a specific date as to when TP documentation must be submitted. However, under the TPDL, there is a statutory deadline in terms of a fixed time period in which TP documentation must be submitted upon the tax authorities request (see below). > Time period or deadline for submission upon tax authority request Before the implementation of the TPDL, TP documentation (Master File and Local File) was usually requested by the competent tax auditor during a tax audit. The submission deadline could vary greatly from case to case (e.g., from only one week to several weeks). Upon the tax auditors consent, an extension of the deadline was possible. On the basis of the TPDL, the deadline for the submission of the TP documentation (Master File and Local File) is 30 days upon the request of the competent tax office after the constituent entity files its tax return.

Yes, Germany has adopted BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation, effective from 1 January 2016. For this purpose, Section 90 (3) General Tax Act had been amended. > Coverage in terms of Master File, Local File and CbCR Yes, Section 90 (3) General Tax Act has been amended to include the obligation to prepare a Master File as well as a Local File if the specific de minimis thresholds are exceeded. Rules regarding CbCR are governed by Section 138a General Tax Act.8 > Effective or expected commencement date German transfer pricing documentation obligations were implemented in 2003. As of fiscal years starting after 31 December 2016, German taxpayers are obliged to prepare a Master Fileor Local File-type transfer pricing documentation. With regard to CbCR, the regulation has been effective since 1 January 2016 (with exception for the surrogate companies effective from 1 January 2017). > Material differences from OECD report template or format In principle, there should not be material differences between the OECD report template or format and Germanys regulatory requirements. However, taxpayers need to be aware that German transfer pricing documentation obligations apply on a transaction-by-transaction basis and that there are no materiality thresholds per transaction. In addition, the catalog provided in the respective executive order law to Section 90 (3) German General Tax Act slightly differs from the OECD Local File template. For example, Section 4 (1) No. 4 lit. a of the executive order law stipulates that the taxpayer has to document the date or period when transfer prices have been determined (price-setting approach). In addition, information available at the time the transfer prices were determined has to be documented (Section 4 (1) No. 4 lit. b). While these differences could be described as clarifications of the OECD Local File template, there is no official statement of the German tax authorities confirming that the German documentation requirements do not exceed the requirements as set forth under the OECD Local File template. In particular, it is questionable whether the specific documentation obligations listed in Section 4 (2) executive order law are in compliance with the OECD Local File template, e.g., the documentation requested for cost allocations or CSAs, research and development activities, explanations for losses, and the impact of business strategies and business restructurings. In practice, German tax authorities often request very detailed and specific information beyond OECD requirements. > Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection It is generally considered reasonable to assume that transfer pricing documentation prepared in line with the BEPS Action 13 format report would not be considered as being essentially unusable under the German penalty rules and regulations. However, taxpayers should be aware that this understanding has not yet been confirmed by a tax court ruling or an official statement by the German tax authorities. Most importantly, taxpayers should be aware that penalties may be levied on a transaction-by-transaction basis without any materiality threshold in terms of intercompany volume. "," Agreement (MCAA) on the exchange of CbCR Yes, as of 27 January 2016. ","? Yes, there are transfer pricing documentation guidelines or rules. The obligation to prepare transfer pricing documentation is included in Section 90 (3) General Tax Act. Documentation for extraordinary transactions, such as corporate restructurings as well as implementation of or changes to material long-term contractual relationships, must be prepared within a reasonably short period (i.e., within six months after the end of the business year in which they occurred). Documentation for all types of transactions must be presented to the authorities upon their request, typically in the course of a tax audit. The time limit for presentation is 60 days following the request (respectively, 30 days in case of extraordinary transactions); extensions may be granted for special reasons. Rules regarding CbCR are governed by Section 138a General Tax Act. The statutory rules on transfer pricing documentation are supplemented by an executive order law to Section 90 (3) German General Tax Act as well as the new administrative circular dated 3 December 2020 (Administrative Principles 2020). "," There is a materiality limit for preparing transfer pricing documentation. Exception for smalland medium-sized companies apply. The company does not have to prepare transfer pricing documentation if annual consideration (paid or received) from intercompany transactions involving the supply of goods with foreign related parties do not exceed EUR6 million and if the annual consideration (paid or received) in connection with other intercompany transactions (e.g. services) do not exceed EUR600,000. Once these de minimis thresholds are exceeded, the transfer pricing documentation obligations apply on a transaction-by-transaction basis without a separate materiality threshold per transaction. Therefore, in principle, transfer pricing documentation has to be prepared for every single intercompany transaction upon request by the tax auditors independent of the transaction volume. ", There is a materiality limit for preparing the BEPS Master File. The Master File only has to be prepared by a German entity where its revenue was higher than EUR100 million in the preceding fiscal year. ," Other than the general de minimis thresholds described above, there are no materiality limits for preparing the Local File.

Transfer pricing documentation requirements a) Applicability > Does the jurisdiction have transfer pricing documentation guidelines or rules? If Yes, does it need to be submitted or prepared contemporaneously? Yes, Mexico has transfer pricing documentation rules. Although transfer pricing report should not be filed on a yearly basis, Article 76 of ITL, Sections IX and XII (it should be kept at taxpayers office), the  Exhibit 9 previously mentioned. > Does a local branch of foreign company need to comply with the local transfer pricing rules?

Transfer pricing documentation must be prepared annually under Mexicos local regulations. Documentation must include the name, address and tax residency of the non resident related parties with which transactions are carried out, as well as evidence of direct and indirect participation between related parties and correct application of a method as stated in Article 180 of the ITL, following the hierarchy established therein. It is necessary to include information regarding the functions performed, assets used, and risks borne by the taxpayer and its related parties involved in each transaction. Information and documentation of comparable transactions or companies by type of transaction must also be included. Therefore, this information must be updated, usually through a comprehensive annual update on the transfer pricing documentation. > For an MNE with multiple entities in the jurisdiction, is it required to have stand-alone transfer pricing reports for each entity? It is mandatory for each taxpayer to prepare and keep transfer pricing documentation, as well as for some taxpayers to prepare and file Master File, Local File and CbCR. Transfer pricing documentation is not an obligation as a multinational group in Mexico but as an individual taxpayer. Therefore, a stand-alone transfer pricing report and Local File should be prepared. The Master File is the only report that could be filed only by one member of the multinational group, specifying which entities are covered under such Master File. b) Materiality limit or thresholds > Transfer pricing documentation Mexican taxpayers conducting intercompany transactions with prior-year income exceeding MXN13 million in regular business activities or exceeding MXN3 million for the provision of professional services are required to prepare and maintain annual transfer pricing documentation.

In addition, public companies in the previous fiscal year are obligated to file the master and Local Files as well, even though they do not meet the applicable threshold. Other entities obligated to file the master and Local File informative returns include legal entities within the optional tax regime (integration system), governmentcontrolled corporations and residents abroad with permanent establishment in Mexico. > Local File The same thresholds as in the Master File section above should be considered. "," The CbCR has to be filed by Mexican MNE-controlling entities with consolidated income equal to or greater than MXN12,000 million.

It is also relevant to consider that the Mexican regulations establish that the SAT may require the legal entities residing in Mexico to provide the CbCR filed by the ultimate parent entity, when the SAT could not obtain the information corresponding to such return through the information exchange methods set forth in the international treaties currently in force by Mexico. To such end, the taxpayers shall have a maximum of 120 business days from the date when the request is made to provide such CbCR.

"," Transfer pricing documentation must be in place when the company files its annual income tax return (by the end of March of the following year) and must be kept, along with the companys accounting records, for at least five years after the filing of the last tax return for each year. If the taxpayer opts to file a Tax Report, transfer pricing documentation could be prepared by 15 July of the following year. If the taxpayer does not file a Tax Report, the obligation is to have prepared the transfer pricing documentation by 31 March of the following fiscal year. For FY2021, if an ISSIF is filed, deadline is also 31 March of the following fiscal year, with potential extension to 30 September 2022. "," There is no formal statutory deadline for the submission of contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation, since it is not filed before the tax authorities; however, either in the ISSIF (31 March of the following fiscal year) or in the Tax Report (15 July of the following fiscal year), the taxpayer must disclose if transfer pricing contemporaneous documentation was prepared, as well as if transfer pricing adjustments were suggested in such documentation, among others. Moreover, in the Exhibit 9 (formal deadline 31 March of the following fiscal year), the information of the transfer pricing documentation must be included. In addition, taxpayers obligated to file a BEPS Local File usually file the corresponding fiscal years transfer pricing documentation as part of the BEPS Local File informative return by 31 December of the following year (deadline to file Local File). > Time period or deadline for submission on tax authority request Visita Domiciliaria: The time could vary from an immediate request (for documents that are part of the taxpayers accounting records) to six working days (other information that is in possession of the taxpayer). Gabinete: The time is 15 working days, plus an extension of 10 working days if requested in writing by the taxpayer. In both cases (Visita Domiciliaria and Gabinete), if the company filed a Tax Report, the audit would initiate through a first request to the tax auditor. In this case, the auditor deadline goes from 6 working days (when it is related to the workpapers developed during the audit procedure) to 15 working days if it is other documentation or information related to the annual Tax Report, but it is in possession of the taxpayer.

New Zealand ," > Has the jurisdiction adopted or implemented BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation in the local regulations? IRD endorses OECDs recommendations and believes that the Master File and Local File approach provides a platform through which taxpayers, subject to the local transfer pricing regime, can meaningfully describe their compliance with the arms-length standard. IRD expects New Zealand taxpayers to maintain contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation in two forms: > A Master File, providing an overview of the multinationals global business operations and transfer pricing policies > A Local File, providing detailed information regarding the operations of the New Zealand taxpayers and main crossborder associated-party transactions, as well as transfer pricing analysis supporting the arms-length nature of these transactions from a New Zealand perspective Only New Zealand-based groups with revenues higher than EUR750 million are required to lodge CbCR. > Coverage in terms of Master File, Local File and CbCR These are expected to comply with OECD recommendations. > Effective or expected commencement date It is expected for income years commencing on or after 1 January 2016. > Material differences from OECD report template or format There is no material difference. > Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection No explicit protection is given simply because a Master File or Local File prepared meets the requirements of BEPS Action 13.

However, there are some notable deviations as reflected below: 1. Royalties/Use of intangibles The tax deductibility of royalties/fees for rights to use intangibles is limited to 5% of the Nigerian company's Earnings Before Interest Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA), as per the Nigerian TP Regulations, and not necessarily in line with the arm's length principle as recommended by the OECD Guidelines. 2. Commodity Transactions For commodity transactions, the Nigerian TP Regulations does not solely rely on the quoted price as recommended by the OECD TP Guidelines. In the case of export, the TP Regulations provides that where commodities are exported from Nigeria to a related party for resale to a third party, the transfer price will be deemed to be the price agreed with the third party if the price is higher than the quoted price. 3. Application of UN Documents The local TP Regulations reference the application of UN documents (in addition to OECD documents) in the interpretation of arm's length principle. Accordingly, in certain circumstances where the UN approach preserves more profit for developing nations, the tax authorities show preference for the application of UN Model. As such, the approach in preparing the Local File should not only consider the recommendation of the OECD but also UN particularly where there are differences.  4. Local TP practices Based on TP audit experience in Nigeria, the Local File is tailored to manage the TP risks of transactions documented in the report rather than just reflecting information as recommended in the OECD Guidelines in order to avoid huge additional assessments and applicable penalties. > Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection A TP report that is compliant with the BEPS Action13 format and includes the points reflected in the paragraph above should meet the requirement of the FIRS.

The CbCR must be prepared in accordance with the format detailed in Annex I of the Superintendence Resolution No. 163 -2018/SUNAT and Annex I of the Superintendence Resolution No. 188 -2018/SUNAT. > Sufficiency of BEPS Action 13 format report to achieve penalty protection Refer to the section Penalty relief. "," Agreement (MCAA) on the exchange of CbCR Yes, as of 9 November 2018. ",? Peru has transfer pricing documentation guidelines and rules. The deadline schedule to submit the Local File informative returns is the same as the one approved for the submission and payment of monthly taxes due in June (tax period May) of the following fiscal year. The deadline schedule to submit the Master File and CbCR informative returns is the same as the one approved for the submission and payment of monthly taxes due in October (tax period September) of the following fiscal year. ," As of 2017, Peruvian transfer pricing formal obligations are aligned with the three-tiered proposal from BEPS, subject to the following conditions. "," Taxpayers that are constituents of a group of companies (both domestic and multinational) and have an annual revenue for the fiscal year of more than 20,000 tax units2 (PEN88 million, approx. USD22 million) and that have carried out transactions with related parties, tax havens, noncooperative jurisdictions or with entities subject to preferential tax regimes for a total amount that is greater than 400 tax units (PEN1.76 million, approx. USD440,000) will be required to submit a Master File with high-level information of the groups business operations, its transfer pricing policies, and its global allocation of income and economic activity. 2The figures have been calculated based on the tax unit corresponding to the year 2021 (PEN4,400). For fiscal year 2022, the tax unit has increased to 4,600. The Master File requirements in Peru are largely consistent with those under Action 13 of the BEPS Action Plan. The information required in the Master File provides a blueprint of the group and contains relevant information that has been grouped into five categories: (1) the groups organizational structure, (2) a description of its business or businesses, (3) the groups intangibles, (4) the groups intercompany financial activities, and (5) the groups financial and tax positions. The filling should be done in October of the following year. "," The Local File documentation requirement applies only to taxpayers whose annual revenue for the fiscal year exceeds 2,300 tax units (PEN10.12 million, approx. USD2.53 million). The Local File provides detailed information relating to intercompany transactions (both domestic and cross-border) and transactions between local taxpayers and residents in tax haven jurisdictions. The second threshold to be observed is the sum of intercompany transactions: Annex I: The taxpayer has carried out transactions with related parties, tax havens, noncooperative jurisdictions or with entities subject to preferential tax regimes for a total amount that is greater than or equal to 100 tax units (PEN440,000, approx. USD110,000) but less than 400 tax units (PEN1.76 million, approx. USD440,000). And Annex II, III and IV: The taxpayer has carried out transactions with related parties, tax havens, noncooperative jurisdictions or with entities subject to preferential tax regimes for a total amount that is greater than 400 tax units (PEN1.76 million, approx. USD440,000). Both conditions should be met. "," In Peru, a CbCR should be filed annually by resident parent entities of MNE groups with annual revenue, as reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the immediately preceding fiscal year, equal to or greater than Peruvian sol (PEN)2.7 billion (approx. USD6.75 billion). For these purposes, an MNE has been defined to include two or more enterprises or entities that are resident of different countries or territories, where at least one of them is resident in Peru. The CbC report requires aggregate tax jurisdiction-wide information relating to the global allocation of the revenue, profits (or losses), income taxes paid (and accrued) and certain indicators of the location of economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which the MNE group operates. The report also requires a listing of all the constituent entities of the MNE group, including the tax jurisdiction of incorporation, where it is different from the tax jurisdiction of residence, as well as the nature of the main business activities carried out by that constituent entity. Resident entities that are constituents of a foreign-based MNE group whose consolidated annual revenue exceeds the threshold will also be required to file the CbCR under the following circumstances: > The ultimate parent of the MNE group is not required to file the CbCR in its jurisdiction of residence. > The CbCR is submitted to the jurisdiction of residence of the ultimate parent company, but Peru has not established an information exchange mechanism with that jurisdiction. > The parent company has submitted the CbCR, and even though Peru has an information exchange mechanism with that jurisdiction, there has been systematic failure to exchange information which has been communicated to the resident constituent entity by SUNAT. > The resident constituent entity has been designated by the foreign-based MNE group as the alternate reporting entity (which files the CbCR instead of the ultimate parent company) and such designation is properly communicated to SUNAT. ", It should be submitted by the end of March or beginning of April based on a schedule. , The deadline schedule to submit the Master File informative returns is the same as the one approved for the submission and payment of monthly taxes due in October (tax period September) of the following fiscal year.

Romania ," > Has the jurisdiction adopted or implemented BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation in the local regulations? Romanian transfer pricing regulations have been amended in view of implementing the changes introduced by BEPS Action 13 for transfer pricing documentation. In 2016, the Romanian regulations regarding the required content of the transfer pricing documentation have been revised in consideration of the elements recommended by the Master File and Local File under the OECD Guidelines to BEPS Action 13; such revised transfer pricing documentation regulations are applicable for tax audits performed by the Romanian tax authorities from 2016 onward, which may also cover tax years prior to 2016. > Coverage in terms of Master File, Local File and CbCR Yes, although a three-tiered documentation format as per BEPS Action 13 (Master File, Local File and CbCR) has not been formally prescribed in the local legislation, the transfer pricing documentation regulations in Romania are, from an overall content requirement perspective, aligned with the prescribed content requirements of the Master File and Local File under BEPS Action 13. Furthermore, the Romanian transfer pricing legislation refers to and is considered to be in line with the OECD Guidelines as amended or revised, and the EU Code of Conduct on transfer pricing documentation. No specific thresholds are applicable for differentiating between the types of elements to be included in the transfer pricing documentation or to be prepared in line with the Romanian transfer pricing documentation requirements.

Yes, transfer pricing documentation, which sets out the evidence of compliance with Part IV TIOPA, needs to be prepared contemporaneously.

For the calculation of profits, the legislation provides an exemption from transfer pricing rules for transactions carried out by a business that is a smallor medium-sized enterprise. However, the exemption only applies to transactions with territories for which there is a full non-discrimination article in the relevant treaty. What constitutes an SME for this purpose is a modification of the European recommendation (2003/361/ EC). An entity qualifies as either smallor medium-sized if it meets the staff headcount ceiling for that class (i.e., 50 or 250, for smallor medium-sized, respectively) and one (or both) of either the annual turnover limit or the balance sheet total limit. The annual turnover limit for small enterprises is GBP10 million; for medium-sized entities, it is GBP50 million.
